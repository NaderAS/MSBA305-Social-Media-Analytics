MSc Computer Science at a good Russell Group University in the UK (ranked around 100 in the world in QS rankings), or MSc Health Data Science at UCL (top 10 in the world)?

Both master's degrees offer modules in machine learning, data science and big data. The MSc in CS offers a module in computer vision. The MSc in Health Data Science offers modules in statistics and computational genomics.

I'm currently in the first year of my MSc in Data Science. Alongside the theoretical coursework, I'm eager to dive deeper into the practical and industry-relevant side of things—especially through hands-on projects.

Right now, I’m still figuring out which specific domain to specialize in, so I'm open to exploring different fields. My current strengths are in Python programming, foundational model development, SQL, and data structures. I feel confident in the theory behind these topics but haven’t had much real-world practice or implementation experience yet.

What would you recommend as a good starting point?
How can I gain more practical exposure and figure out where I might fit best.

I’m from a commerce background — now wrapping up my bachelors. Honestly, after graduation, I’ll be unemployed with no major skillset that’s in demand right now.

Recently, my dad’s friend’s wife (she’s in a senior managerial role in some tech/data firm) suggested I take up Data Science. She even said she might be able to help me get a job later if I really learn it well. So now I’m considering giving it a serious shot.

Here’s the thing — I know squat about Data Science. No coding background. BUT I’m very comfortable with computers in general and I pick things up pretty quickly. I just need a proper starting point and a roadmap.

Would really appreciate:

✅ Beginner-friendly courses (Udemy, Coursera, edX, etc. — I don’t mind paying if it’s worth it)

✅ Good YouTube channels to follow

✅ A step-by-step roadmap to go from zero to employable

✅ Anyone who has been in a similar non-tech background and transitioned successfully — I’d love to hear how you did it

Little bit of background, I'm a 24 year old Bio-analytical Graduate living in Ireland. I was registered to start a Bioinformatics Masters last September which fell through last minute. I ended up enrolling in a Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science with The Data Science Institute which operates through Woolf University.

I have the option to continue my studies into a full Masters but I'm unsure as I'm weary on the status of the University (Rankings, Employer recognition, Etc.). Ideally I'm looking for an online masters as I'm working from home as a caregiver for a family member during the day.

I'm considering taking my PDip. and applying for a different full masters such as the Online Msc. Statistics and Data Science from KU Leuvan. Honestly I'm abit lost at the moment as I've had alot of opportunities fall through in the last year. I suppose I'm asking 2 main questions.

**1.** Is a Data Science masters worth it? What's the Job market like, I'm open to moving anywhere in the world.

**2.** Does the University status matter, my course is accredited in Europe and all credits are ETCS, will employers be looking into that much or are they more likely to be looking at my portfolio of past projects?

2) proving value.

You say this is sorted, but I’m surprised you’re having issues if so. Making what we do measurable and robust is hard. And we (often) hold ourselves to higher standards than accepted ROI generators like Email marketing. If you’re _really_ showing value, what’s their beef?


With both, you’re going to struggle to argue against a flashy consultant pitch, which (from experience) are often hugely overblown, and rarely deliver what was expected.

I took their offer to come back for grad school for what might as well have been a free MS in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.

Columbia masters programs are infamous cash cows.  I don’t have the numbers in front of me but their statistics masters program graduates like 500 statistics masters students per year while NC State - which has a huge number of faculty - graduates about 200 statistics masters students per year.

Speaking from experience as someone who did a master’s at a different prestigious school where we didn’t learn mich and did not get to interact with famous faculty, please be aware that you’re probably paying for a fancy name on a degree and not much else.  In the case of Columbia, not only are you paying almost $34000 per semester, but you have to deal with the exorbitant cost of living in New York City.  That means if you're doing the program full-time, then you will have - minimum - $135K in debt at a high interest rate.  Do you think that makes financial sense?

# Copied and pasted from another past comment:

As someone who attended a master's program at a prestigious university that was super expensive and had a mediocre masters’ curriculum, here's my advice.

First of all, it's tricky to define a ""good"" master's program.  If the program has a good curriculum and good alumni placement, then it's good.  However, if the program teaches almost nothing, gives you a really expensive piece of paper, and has good alumni placement, is it ""good"" because of the outcomes even though the actual program itself sucks?  My master's program was in the latter category.  I learned almost nothing that I didn't know already, but found a high-paying job after graduation that I would not have been able to get without a master's with that university's name on the degree.  If you're debating between a less prestigious program with a great curriculum and a more prestigious program with a bad curriculum, then it's up to you to figure out which best fits your goals.

Additionally, the quality of a master’s program is often independent of the quality of the department as a whole.  My graduate department regularly put out world-class research with professors who are very famous, but only the PhD students got to learn from them.  The master’s program was much less rigorous and totally isolated from what the PhD students were doing.

I highly recommend looking at what alumni are doing on LinkedIn.  Don't be afraid to contact them and ask to set up a quick phone call to discuss the program.  If the program is really good or really bad, you'll find people willing to tell you about it.

**Things you should look up in general**

* Does the program publish employment statistics?  Do alumni have jobs that you're interested in?

* How much is the program?  If it'll put you $100K+ in debt without any chance of financial assistance, it's almost certainly a cash grab program.

* How many master's students graduate each year?  If it's a huge number (like 300+), then it's probably a cash grab.  For reference, NC State is a well-respected statistics institution.  They typically have around 200 total grad students.

* Is the program taught by tenure-track or tenured faculty, or is it taught mostly by lecturers or industry people?  This is important even if the department has a lot of well-known professors because you might not get to interact with them.

* Do you get to take electives, or is it a cohort where you and your fellow grad students all take the same courses?  If you don't get to mix with the PhD students then it's probably a cash cow.

* Does the program offer a thesis option?  If it does, then it's less likely to be a cash cow program.

* Is the program at NYU or Columbia?  Those two are notorious for extremely expensive cash cow masters programs.

**Things to look for when snooping on LinkedIn:**

* What kinds of work are alumni doing according to their LinkedIn profiles?  Does the work look like it pays well?  Was their first job out of the program close to the university, or are jobs more geographically spread out?  If alumni are spread out, then that indicates that the university is well-respected outside of its immediate location.  However, this might not be an issue if you want to stay in the area of the university.

* How does the above vary based on *undergrad* experience?  For example, are people who went to lesser-known undergrad universities working jobs that are clearly worse than people who went to better universities?  This is important because if this is the case, then it's an indication that the program might not actually be teaching much, in which case alumni are being placed based on where they were when they entered the program, rather than because the program actually teaches anything good.  My program definitely had worse placement for people with non-traditional backgrounds compared to those with stronger quantitative experience.

* What does career trajectory for experienced alumni (like 5+ years) look like?  Are they moving to more senior roles, or are they moving around from company to company without any obvious increase in responsibility?


**Things to ask alumni**

I emphasize *alumni*, rather than current students, because they actually finished the program and know whether or not it helped them.  They also have no more ties to the university and can speak more candidly.  (Dropouts are fine too.)

* Who was your advisor, and how were they to work with?  If the advisor was a micromanager or shitty, I guarantee you will hear about it.  Also, note that even if a professor is a good lecturer, they can still be a terrible advisor.  My advisor was very well-liked by students who took courses with him and talked to him around the department and even won many teaching awards.  However, as an advisor, he dictated every part of my capstone project and didn't allow me to have any input into it.

* Are professors generally friendly and approachable?  In some departments, professors leave their office doors open and schmooze with their students.  In others, professors constantly act like they've above students in every way and clearly respect PhD students more than master's students, and may or may not respect masters students more than undergrads.  Outside of machine learning I've heard of people deciding not apply to UChicago's Economics PhD program because while it's the most prestigious department in economics, it's dominated by pompous assholes.

* How was university career services?  For reference, I found my first job out of grad school through a posting on my university's internal job board after their career services helped me understand what resources they had.  Additionally, some universities have recruiters at companies that focus entirely on recruiting students from that particular university.

* In hindsight, would you have done this program, or would you have done something else?

moudt4d,1k6wi45,lelakat,"I think it depends a lot on what department the program is in. 

The business school in the University? I'm much more weary of it  than if it came from a sciences school. Business schools, in my experience, focus so much on the basics and barebones of things. Very big picture focused, but they also seem to make the assumption the people their graduates will ultimately be working with is less technically minded. A program of a school of sciences in my experience, would focus a lot more on the math behind things, technical details, processes and would assume your audience is going to be people with a heavy math background. 

I've found that a lot of business schools data science programs focus on getting projects set up, and how to get buy in from leadership on how to get approval for data projects. So I see those programs as more for someone who is just begining to go into Data Science or someone who wants to manage data Scientists but needs to understand the big picture of what they are doing. I see Data Science programs from a school of sciences or from under a Computer Science or Math umbrella as focused on the math and makeup of algorithms and focused more on the pure ""doing"" of things. 

Both have their uses but between the two, I think many people enter data science programs that are more focused on the business side of things when they expect to be getting the practical math side of things and vice versa. 

Data Science and everything with it have become giant corporate buzzwords. Lots of universities know a company will pay money for an employee to get a certification or degree or that a student will pay to try and get to the next level of their career. While any degree can be a networking opportunity, you really do have to do a lot of due diligence on the curriculum to make sure you're getting what you're looking for.

moof81g,1k63zii,azntechyuppie,"IMO it depends a lot on the company and the team you're interviewing for. If you're looking at a FAANG or similar big tech, they're probably going to want to see some level of both depth and breadth in your answers.

First off, you don't \*always\* need to get super complex with your metrics. Don't forget that the basics like DAUs (Daily Active Users), conversion rates, and view rates are \*foundational\* and show that you know your stuff. But if you can throw in some creative, ""out-of-the-box"" metrics on top of that, like looking at user stickiness via DAU / MAU , that's gonna flex your product thinking a bit more.

For me, it's not just rattling off the metrics you mention but your approach to reaching those metrics. Do you ask insightful clarifying questions? Are you able to drive the conversation to logical, data-driven conclusions? Are you thinking about how different factors could affect those metrics? That's what'll likely make them go, ""Oh yeah, we want this one."" 

The best candidates can reason over tradeoffs. The worst ones go through a checklist that isn't really ordered by any kind of thoughtfulness / priority. 

As for A/B tests, mentioning them is usually good because it shows you understand the importance of experimentation. But, tbh, it's the same thing, WHY do we need to use A/B tests in this situation?

Lastly, if you can weave in some specialized industry knowledge or talk about potential pitfalls (think dirty data, feature bias, etc.), that'll make you stand out. Most people treat this too generically and every case study as in a box. Every company is different and specialized research always matters and shows that you have been actually thinking about this problem.",8,1745442694.0

Do you understand why the product would be valuable to the business, and how to measure that value? Do you understand the assumptions that build up that value? Can you specify metrics that would show those assumptions are/are not being met? Can you determine what is upstream and downstream among those metrics? Can you sequence what is most important to measure?

The metrics themselves should be dead simple. The simpler and more common the better in fact. If you find yourself rabbit holing on something insanely specific you’re probably going in the wrong direction.",3,1745433087.0
monix9q,1k63zii,ghostofkilgore,"You'd be surprised how many candidates really struggle to give reasonable answers around metrics. Generally, we're just looking for sensible metrics that make sense, and a candidate can justify. They don't have to be the ones we actually use, and they don't need to go into incredible detail. We just want to see that candidates can think about the problem, weigh up some options, and come up with reasonable model and product metrics.

Given that we generally only interview experienced candidates, it's one of the areas where candidates really shouldn't struggle, but most do.

I'm not totally sure whether it's because people get inside their own heads too much with these kinds of questions and assume it's some kind of trick question or whether lots of people don't really think broadly about metrics and so just go with whatever they know best even if it's isn't particularly suitable.

Honestly, even when people are questioned about why a metric might be good or bad, most candidates really struggle. Candidates tend to be much more comfortable talking about ML models, feature engineering, etc. But so many trip up on what I'd say are probably more simple questions.",1,1745433297.0
monknr1,1k63zii,IntrepidAstronaut863,"One thing I don’t see enough of on CVs or in interviews at the moment from data scientists is measurements of success of a project.

I’m hiring data science roles related to Gen AI and I see a lot of “built rag solution for x”, “fine tuned model for y” or “used agents for z”

That’s great but you’re the data scientist. I understand it gets blurry between SWE and data science sometimes but I have SWE’s that build the products and I want to hire a guy that 

1. Evaluates whether the model we’re using is the best and why?
2. Evaluates if the product or new feature is successful and why?

That requires metrics and metrics are different depending on the use case and part of your job is to understand and know which metric is best for that case. 

For example recall would be really important if we’re measuring performance of a medical diagnosis tool while precision might be really important for measuring a spam classification tool. 

In the CV and interview I’m looking to see “Implemented a rag solution for x which resulted in a 26% decrease in the rejection rate”. 

Follow up questions why was rejection rate is the most important measure for this project? How did you decide to use a certain search or chunk strategy? (here looking for metrics again, not read some blog or paper that said it was, that’s a small red flag to me)

moohcqf,1k63zii,Adventurous_Persik,"I’ve had a few interviews like this where they dove straight into product metrics and expected detailed answers with little context, and honestly, it threw me off more than once. I remember one interview where they asked me to measure success for a feature that hadn’t even launched yet. I tried to ask clarifying questions, but they kept pushing for an answer as if there was one “right” metric. It felt less like a conversation and more like a test I didn’t study for. I left that interview second-guessing myself, even though I knew I was qualified. That kind of pressure makes it really hard to demonstrate actual thinking skills because you're too busy trying to guess what *they* want to hear.

What helped me the next time around was being upfront about how I approach ambiguous problems. I started framing my responses around assumptions, explaining what data I’d ideally want, and outlining how I’d validate success. That seemed to land better, and one interviewer even told me afterward that they appreciated my transparency in walking through the thought process. I think the key is realizing you don’t have to pretend to know everything—you just need to show how you’d *figure it out*.

mon00xb,1k63zii,Single_Vacation427,"Like in which situations? An interview?

I don't think you should come up with a ""out of the box"" metric in an interview because it's not what they are asking for and it would also be the wrong approach. Even if you are working there, you need to work with metrics available because creating a new metric from scratch takes a lot of time, work, resources. 

If you were given a problem to solve at work in a limited time frame and your solution involves creating a new metric or using a metric people don't care about or using a different metric than everyone else uses, that's going to create more problems for your results/report/solution. Getting people to adopt new metrics and get buy-in from stakeholders for new metrics is quite a bit of work.

 Also try to think of non traditional variables. Credit risk is about inclusion.

Also try using a credit bureau score to baseline the performance thats the line in the sand. Other than that a previous version of a score is also viable. 

 i also probably recommend is look at fraud. There can be fraud masked as default hence why you are getting bad noise.

Also there can be assumptions that are wrong with your target. If you try to detect default ever ur auc will be bad. Often not there can be a lot of noise in your target given different payment patterns, a mistake in ur target, or straight up bad feature. However I have a feeling that you most likely didnt explore how to handle binned data or if you observed the stability of your variables over time.

\- Try to use shap on your current model, especially try to understand the effect of each variables and the interactions effect. Try different set of variables and avoid too correlated one will help to see better effect.  
\- If your model are underfitting, try to break down variables where the effect may not be linear (because you use linear reg) for example income. Try to do non linear combination of variable (like ratio) if there is a strong shap interaction. Add more variables if you can (historical relationship, credit card data?)  
\- If your model are overfitting, try to reduce number of variable :group categories together if it makes sense (like similar social group). Or remove redundant variable (if you have the total income and total expense, no need to add something like total saving).  
\- Try to find instances where your models get really wrong about some observations and look at the shap for these instance and the data yourself. A lot of time you can see something interesting. Or you can also see that the target is so much random inherently.

(2) While I was still working in gaming, I had a grad school classmate who was interested in a referral and asked to see my resume for some inspiration. He came back a few days later and asked me to review his resume for any errors, and all he did was remove my name from different parts of it and add his name in its place with a few other position details changed. 95% of it was a straight up copy paste. I warned him that he would get in a ton of trouble for plagiarism and lying about his experience and opted out of giving him a referral.

mo3majb,1k3nxj7,Atmosck,">Simple aggregations and other tasks require so much code.

This tells me there are probably a lot of things pandas can you you simply aren't aware of. I'm hard pressed to come up with a ""simple"" aggregation that doesn't have a dataframe method. I'd be curious to hear what operations you're thinking of that require ""so much code"" - pandas can probably do them in one line. And for more complex stuff you can do pretty much anything with .apply(lambda: ...) or .groupby.apply. I've witnessed this quite a bit reviewing job application take-home assignments, ""oh, they spent 50 lines setting up a complicated iteration because they didn't know pandas has a method that just does that""

>But more confusng is the syntax, which seems to be odds with itself at times. Sometimes we put the column name in the parentheses of a function, other times be but the column name in brackets before the function.

parentheses = function arguments; brackets = slicing. When you do something like this:

`df_team_stats = df_game_scores.groupby(['season', 'team_id'])[['touchdowns', 'yards']].describe()`

`df.groupby()` is a function, that creates technically a **DataFrameGroupBy** object but conceptually it's basically a list of dataframes for each group. We put the function arguments in the parentheses, and the only required argument is the group columns - you can pass a list of columns like above, or a single column like `df.groupby('team_id')` . With groupby typically the reason to use it is to apply some function to each group, in this case .describe() which gives some summary stats like mean and stdev. With `df.groupby(...).describe()` that will give you the description of every column, but we only care about a couple of them so we *slice* the grouper to get just the columns we care about before calling describe, like `df.groupby(...)[cols].describe()`. You could also write `df.groupby(...).describe()[cols]` but that's less efficient, because it calculates the summary stats for every column, and then discards the columns we don't care about after.

There's perhaps a little confusion with the fact that we use square brackets both to write python lists, and for slicing. `df['colname']` is not a function - we have square brackets right next to df indicating that we're slicing it, in this case selecting a single column. `df[['col1', 'col2']]` is also slicing, but in this case instead of a single column, we're using a list of columns, hence the inner square brackets. `df['colname'].mean()` is applying a function to that single column we got from slicing; `df.mean()['colname']` is applying a function to the original dataframe, then slicing the result.

Pandas does have idiosyncrasies and downsides. The extreme flexibility does mean the syntax is sometimes at odds with what's considered ""pythonic,"" and it can be quite slow, especially if you're iterating when you could be using a vectorized method or doing repeated indexing inside a loop. For performance critical things it is often worth just sticking to numpy.

Pandas, therefore, already exists at a disadvantage compared to Tidyverse, because of the underlying nature of the language. R is a statistics programming language, Python is an everything programming language. What makes Pandas useful is the fact that it contains most of the necessary functions and syntax to do ML and data analysis, while still being a Python package (and therefore getting all those Python advantages).

\##################################################################

Tldr syntax explanation btw.  
Forget quotations v/s no quotes for now. If you are not using .loc or .iloc, column name comes first, followed by row name (usually index). 2 options for how you do this

Dataframe\[""column name""\]\[:\]  #select eveerything from column\_name  
(assuming the index name is just a number, you can configure it to be something else if you want while making the dataframe).   
Dataframe.column\_name.row\_index #assuming column name is 1 word with no spaces.

If you're using .iloc or .loc, the index/name respectively of the row you want comes first.  
Your options here are

Dataframe.iloc\[0,""column\_name""\] #(I think), returns 1 element assuming I've got the syntax right, may be double brackets  
Dataframe.iloc\[0\]\[""column\_name""\]  #Dataframe.iloc\[0\] returns a series of all elements in the 0th row of the dataframe with index = all the columns of the dataframe, you then query that series for the specific column you want.

To my recollection there is another form of syntax which goes something like Dataframe\[\[""Column\_name"",""index""\]\] but its not needed, just another option that does the exact same thing (its something which irritates me about programming in general is there's 800 functionally identical ways to do the exact same bloody thing).

At my gig, if whomever is developing on a working branch doesn’t run them before pushing and PRing into main, every test is run automatically when anything is merged into main and, subsequently, before anything is built. If tests fail, the build fails, and the maintainer is emailed about the build failing.

We have unit tests in all of our pipelines, including for internal tools/libraries. This is good software development. It prevents someone from fucking something up. 

Code is broken into the smallest chunks needed for functionality and each fix is tested. This is how unit tests operate. They are simple and all are pretty much a test of “is this thing still doing what I expect it to do?”",47,1745122741.0

Here are some examples from a real project:
The project is an audio pipeline to transcribe phone calls.
One part is to read the audio file into waveform array. There are a bunch of tests:
- test happy cases for all codecs that we support
- test when the audio file is empty, should raise error properly
- test when the audio file is corrupted or missing
- test when audio file is above the size limit
- test when the codec is not supported
- test when the sampling rate is not standard

A misconception about tests is to think they verify that the code works. No, if the code doesn’t work you would know rightaway. Tests are made to prevent futures bugs.

mo30eo3,1k3e4nb,random-code-guy,"As others have described how unit tests should work and their importance, my 2 cents about then in a MLOps flow:

Usually you want to check two main pillars with UT (unit tests):
1. How’s the environment working? Is everything set up correctly? Ex: if your flow uses spark, is the spark session correctly set up? Are your model instances correctly configured with their hyper parameters? Are you correctly importing files that are expected to be used? 

2. Given an action, is the output correctly set? Here it’s the main core of UT. This is where you go through each function of the code (or atleast the main ones) and test if their inputs and outputs works correctly. Ex: if you have a function that does a SQL select, and does some data engineering, does the final table has the right amount of columns as expected? When you save this, does the file saves correctly? Are the tests for your model post training correctly set and working? 

3. Post actions. Here is where you test if the final outputs of your code are really working. Ex: If your flow exports a file or a table at the end, does it exports to the right place? Is the table really created/updated? 

It doesn’t changes much from software engineering UT, I tink that maybe the test logic may be differently structured. If you wanna know more there are a few good books you can read about (I recommend the “Python testing with pytest”, simple and right to the point for a nice introduction on the topic).",3,1745153526.0

While I was pretty good at backend and could create a functional frontend, I always felt that my frontend work left something to be desired, and was frustrated that my apps didn't look as good as I knew they were.

Most top-tier companies are using Nextjs + React + Typescript for their frontend now, so in the interest of career opportunities, I suggest getting to know those. Luckily, we live in a time of extremely user-friendly frontend tools. Lovable makes it super easy to spin up great looking Nextjs apps with AI prompting, and Cursor or Windsurf IDEs make getting into unknown code so much easier. Don't be afraid to dive into something new - it can be very rewarding to pick up side hustles and now is the best time ever to start learning frontend.",47,1745019149.0

Personally I've been a dev for my first 10ish years and then did a PhD and was in more MLy roles for the next 10 years.
Now I'm seeing that same as in the last 2 years I barely need my ML/DS knowledge anymore.

That being said, I also found that few of our developers go beyond just calling the LLM APIs and while most of the ""AI Engineering"" stuff isn't rocket science, they still struggle to get simple ideas around Training vs Inference, ask questions like if you ""train"" a model with RAG if the data is instantly available to the model, the whole idea of embedding models is still a challenge for many etc.

As I typically work more in the intersection to product and business people I also found that even pretty technical product people nowadays have a really hard time to understand the difference between running a model yourself vs calling some SaaS provider API. They've become so used to everything being a 3rd party API that the concept of inference on a model on your own machine has become really foreign to many ;).

So while my work has become more devy again, I still find myself dragged into so many projects and proposals and customer discussions because there's such stuff all the time... What's reasoning models, what's tool calling, what about agents, what are those 3 million new frameworks, what about multimodal models etc. There is still a lot of meat",4,1745045438.0

I turned off copilot off in vscode because I found it takes me longer to read the suggested auto fill and determine 9/10 times that it's not what I'm looking for, than to just write what I was gonna write.

I do use chat GPT quite a bit though. Often for high level stuff (is this division of responsibilities between classes appropriate? Is this design overlooking anything?) or the conceptually easy but tedious stuff (write me a pydantic model for this json; translate this pandas code into something numba-compatible). I come to DS from a math background and am mostly self taught as a programmer, so it's been very helpful to ask about best practices or libraries I'm not familiar with (is there an out of the box option for [domain specific cross validation requirements]? How do I unit tests?)

Where it fails is for more complex coding tasks. It will often give you something that works in a stupid or obvious way that misses the nuance. For example I once asked it to give me code to join one dataframe with rolling aggregations of another, with daily data over several years. It wanted to do just join first, filter on date, then aggregate, which you can imagine created a ridiculous memory bottleneck. This kind of thing happens with SQL a lot to - many unnecessary CTEs and stuff.

Postman, Heidisql, Notepad++ and of course GitHub are other things I use daily.

mnyf71e,1k26kp3,hrokrin,"I'm all over the place. Part of that is because I don't think I have a great system now but part is because I actively look for improvement. So, here is what I have.

**Code**: Mostly (neo)vim but I really think it need to up my game. I foray into VSCode but find massive number of options with no structure to be difficult to love as is the excess visual crap. But also use Jupyter notebooks as a REPL. PyCharm for the infrequent big project. I haven't used DataStorm. 

**Virtual environment**: (mini)Conda. I should go to UV, but I like the naming and structure of conda a lot. But not the integration with pip.

**Notebooks**: Jupyter (as above) but moving to and prefer Ibis, which I think is far superior. Barring that, polars. But Ibis is amazing. 

**Artifacts**: In order, I like:

* Evidence - Damn this is nice for stuff that involves tabular data. Beautiful.
* Quarto - I love the range of products that can be produced.
* Holoviz  - I need more time with this. Very impressive.
* Plotly Express -  I have only good things to say about it
* Streamlit - I really want to like it, but past a certain level of complexity, I find it tough to use. However, it's faster to make stuff than Dash.
* Seaborn & Folium - What they do, they do well.
* Matplotlib - I figured out why I don't like Matplotlib a few months back. It's the cousin of the late 1990s/early-2000s HTML. Meaing it means the best looking output requires you to hand code every design element and anything else looks like shit. The flexibility is awesome, though.
* Plotly Dash - I really want to like it, but the MVC paradigm is foreign to me, and it's yuck to use with both key and value having to be in quotes, old documentation that makes help problematic, and a non-pythonic structure, and the need to use graph objects.

**Cloud**: Mostly Azure because they've been best about providing free certification exams, have better pricing and transparency towards the pricing, and good integration with the rest of the MSFT stuff like GitHub, VS Code, etc. 

**Data interchange**: Arrow compliance all the way.

* Parquet - I bring stuff in with CSV or pickle if required, but everything goes out in Parquet. If it could keep the same compression but also allow you to see it like you can it like csv (which is impossible due to the compression), I'd want to marry it. 

**LLMs:** Maybe I'm just doing things wrong, but I haven't had much success with them. They're great if you want to generate 50x the code and 100-200x the errors in a given amount of time. They have a hard time past a certain level of complexity. Frequently, that means removing working code or adding another dependency. And the code generated seems to be regression to the mean. On the other hand, I love being complimented and told how I'm right by sycophantic models that keep making the same mistakes while sounding very confident in their abilities. Now, to be fair, I don't use any paid version. I'm not against it, but I want to know if it makes me more effective, as in actually productive, not effective as in troubleshooting the code produced.",1,1745082966.0

1) Overall direction: make sure people are working on the important problems and using their skills efficiently. Some of this will come from above you, and you need to translate and delegate it to get the most output in the least time. 


2) Removing roadblocks: get your team the resources and answers they need to keep projects moving. When things stall, find out why and unblock it. Maybe make systemic changes to mitigate that type of blocker in the future.

1. An investment in my growth rather than only focusing on how I can help the business through immediate projects
2. A respect for my autonomy, letting me figure out how to solve problems and allowing me to say what is or isn't possible and in what timeframe
3. A level of self-awareness and able to handle conflict in a constructive way that allows for collaborative problem solving
4. Can keep the team generally happy and with a positive attitude, as opposed to being burned out and angry
5. Recognises work that you're doing, even if you think your work is ""nothing special"", they still sing your praises and help to get your name out there
6. Cares about your well-being outside of work to understand what kind of workload to put you under, or if you should be protected while you deal with things
7. Shields you from distractions from the work you need or what to do. This means doing their best to minimise ad-hoc requests and so on

DiD is typically used in observational settings when you can’t randomly assign people to groups (e.g., when a new law gets passed in some cities but not others). You observe pre and post periods for both treatment and control groups and “difference the differences” to account for confounding factors that don’t change over time.

Incremental testing usually refers to experimental setups like A/B testing, lift studies, or holdout tests, where you randomly assign people to treatment and control - in essence, you control the setup of your experiment. 

Because of randomization, you can directly measure the incremental effect of your action without needing to correct for baseline differences (ideally).

mnj0sae,1k0zcye,Atmosck,"this is MLOPS - how do you deliver a model, and how do you feed the model?

Whatever data enrichment you're doing should happen to both your training data and your prediction inputs. Really the design of your training set should simulate the inputs you'll have at prediction data, by having a separate routine for building your training data that stops short of any transformations that should be applied to the present data - so mostly joins. Then store your ""raw"" training in a sql database or something, and append this daily (or whatever) for future training. Then you can have shared code between your prediction pipeline and your training/validation/etc routines that applies feature engineering (basically any new columns you create from what you already have) and preprocessing (normalization and one-hot encoding and stuff) so that your model is getting matching inputs in both settings.

A lazier approach might have a single training script that queries a bunch of raw data sources (and maybe even has to carefully pace API calls) and does potentially slow aggregations and stuff every time you train. But having this extra stop where you put the joined data in a database before you do other stuff to it, gives you a clean way to separate out the logic that also needs to be applied to the current data for prediction, and it avoids doing redundant work.

If you are giving your .train and your .predict functions different kinds of data, your result won't just be inaccurate, it will be nonsensical. Like all 0s or something.

Ultimately a machine learning pipeline is some data sources and a chain of things that have .transform and sometimes .fit functions and then a landing spot for what comes out the other side. The beginning and end of that chain might differ between training and your prediction setting, but the steps in between should share code as much as possible to ensure consistency, and should use data storage to avoid doing redundant work.",2,1744861370.0

The scientists who say that it's fine to train on enriched data and then run on non-enriched data are wrong. Either because they're suggesting using a model that won't have key features in it in production, or because they're insisting on using useless enriched features. 

More generally, I think the best way to work with scientists is not to think of your job as support. You're a partner in the operation. It's not your job to blindly do what the scientists say; you should be actively engaged in understanding your data. Particularly in regard to practical issues like the enrichment problem you mentioned, problems with error corrections and updating in historical data, reliability issues, etc. 

High-level, model deployment isn't rocket science. Your production data should be identical to your training data.

1) The company I worked at sent direct / white mail every month, 500k pieces of paper and it was always done, and they were incredibly resistant to the idea of creating control groups.  Then we cannot contact people and we won't sell as much.  The conversion on these things were less than 1%.  But the business supported them because ""hey we've always done it, we know our business, what do these data kids know.""

Then I presented this not in sales but in return.  Ie how much did these campaigns bring in and compared this to the costs.  I called this crazy new way of thinking Return on Invest... super genius right? Sure its gonna catch on.

But this showed that most of these campaigns cost the company rather than generating returns.  

Suddenly the department and business is on board with doing control groups and tests.  What changed? It was positioned in a way that they understood and cared about.

  
2) A junior data scientist wanted to build the fanciest model possible to predict churn.  He wanted all the data.  He spent months arguing with Data Privacy (we are in the EU) and got nowhere, and his model was crap.  

Eventually this got reassigned to me.  I built a quick model based on how the customers acted, which I understood after talking to the business.  This model saved the business €1m a month.

Could my model have been made better with better data? Hell yes.  Was it worth waiting another year and not delivering anything.  Hell no.

Most people are interpreting it as you saying that storytelling is useless, and you should only focus on complicated techniques that interest you.

But I don't get the sense that that is what you were trying to say.

In this industry, there is a LARGE proportion of people that are doing what I would call ""performance theatre.""

They look like they are delivering value and big impacts, but really, they are just storytellers that don't provide anything of value.

It is also really hard to distinguish the two unless you yourself are an expert in the field.

Storytelling is important, but storytelling is not the same thing as actually delivering value.

You can convince people you are delivering value with storytelling, but you can't actually deliver value with storytelling alone.

The actual value and business impact always comes from the insights and changed decisions/workflow that stem from your deployed solutions.

I cannot tell you how many churn solutions I've seen where people telling me they saved the company X million dollars a year, but when you actually ask how they determined that number, it is all just storytelling bullshit.

Storytelling is an extremely important skill, but it's not the value driver, IMO.

Now, I know some people will get offended because the entire job of most data analysts is to tell stories, which IMO doesn't provide much actual value or impact most of the time.

But I'm biased because I focus more on predictive analytics problems rather than data analysis problems. So your mileage may vary :)",2,1744904839.0

mnqlbtq,1k0vdku,Charming-Back-2150,This is posed very strangely. I’d say the structure is not typical. Train 1 model type on on k different splits of the data. So model a would have 4 different model instances trained on training set 1-4. This will allow you to quantify the approximate uncertainty in the data and model. Then you can compare the bias / variance of each model to see if each one is overfitting a specific sub portion of your data. What you have proposed would massively over fit a subsection of your data.,2,1744973439.0
mo69u2w,1k0vdku,Charming-Back-2150,"Yeah, this setup is way more complex than it needs to be and is likely introducing bias. A few thoughts:
	1.	Don’t switch model types per outer fold.
You’re selecting a different “best” model per spatial fold — that’s noisy as hell. Instead, pick a few candidate model types (e.g., RF, XGBoost, etc.) and evaluate each one consistently across all outer folds. Then compare their average performance.
	2.	Nested CV should be per model type.
Outer loop = estimate generalization (spatial split),
Inner loop = tune hyperparams (temporal split).
So for each outer fold, you tune each model type using inner folds, test it on the outer fold, and log the results.
	3.	Pick the final model based on average outer fold performance.
Whichever model performs best on average across outer folds is your winner. Then you retrain that model on the full 70% and test on the 30% holdout.
	4.	Track variance too.
Mean performance is nice, but variance across folds tells you a lot about model stability. You don’t want a model that only performs well on one lucky fold.

Right now you’re kinda blending model selection and cross-validation structure too tightly. Keep those separate and you’ll avoid overfitting to fold-specific quirks.",2,1745193317.0
mnc5y87,1k082ij,Atmosck,"Traditionally a *time series* is a measurement of a single variable at a fixed frequency so you might not call this one, but it has a lot in common with a time series, so TimeSeriesSplit is still appropriate. You're predicting a distribution for each customer, who individually would get quotes at uneven intervals. So your cross-validation should simulate the past-future barrier that you'll have in production.

If you split randomly you can have leakage thanks to long-term trends. Say for example 2024 had a 10% higher purchase rate than 2023. Then your model will learn from 80% of quotes in 2024 and apply that knowledge to predicting the other 20%, and appear smarter than it would actually be.

But if you do random split, your performance metrics (e.g., AUC) will most likely be inflated compared to what you see in production because you’re using past data to evaluate a model trained with future data, which will not happen in production.

mn7fbhl,1jzml32,Cuidads,"Most current deployments are just scripted workflows in the backend, usually by a RAG framework. When the scope is narrow and the implementation is good, they can appear to have agency, but that’s all it is.

These semi-autonomous systems can be very much useful (business value wise), but they’re not as dramatic a shift from what we had a few years ago as they might seem. The main difference is that natural language now triggers workflows instead of code or UI buttons. It’s essentially the next step after low-code and no-code tools. 

Anyone claiming to have truly agentic AI is almost certainly working within a very tightly constrained use case (or lying for marketing). 

The core issues haven’t gone away. You still can’t debug LLM-driven systems like traditional software. Even with trace logs and prompt chains, it’s like trying to reason with a hallucinating intern who forgets what they just did. Agents still struggle to maintain state or recover from failure in a robust way. Tool use is fragile, API name mismatches, auth errors, or schema changes can break everything, and unlike humans, agents can’t adapt on the fly. Safety and control are real concerns too; no one wants an agent that spams emails or corrupts data, so human-in-the-loop remains essential. And perhaps most critically, we still lack good ways to evaluate these systems. Outside of narrow task benchmarks, it’s hard to say whether they’re actually performing well or just getting lucky.

Things can always change quickly. This could look very different in a year, but I suspect the limitations are fundamental to LLM architecture, and maybe even to neural networks and backpropagation at their core. If that’s the case, and to put it a bit bluntly, most of these so-called agentic systems are really just rebranded expert systems from the ’80s and on, now with a natural language interface layered on top. The backend is still a brittle web of conditional logic that doesn’t generalize. Two years ago, I wasn’t sure how deep the problem ran, but at this point I find myself fully aligned with Yann LeCun’s perspective on this:

Think internal ticket triaging, automated document drafting (with human approval), or simple form processing—low-risk, repetitive, and well-defined tasks.

Still, debugging is messy, hallucination risks are real, and most orgs aren’t ready to hand over the keys just yet.

You nailed it with “open-ended research” being the most plausible application for now. For deeper system interaction, we’re probably a few iterations away from meaningful reliability. Until then, it’s mostly hybrid setups—agent + human-in-the-loop.

mmyq2c3,1jyicx6,Raz4r,"The main reason, in my view, is that they’re easy to teach and easy to understand. Anyone with a basic grasp of regression can follow how forward or backward selection works. It's intuitive, transparent, and feels more ""hands-on"" than many modern alternatives.

Now, try introducing LASSO or some other fancy regularization-based model selection technique to a room full of economists with 20+ years of industry experience. Chances are, they won’t buy into it. There’s often skepticism around methods that feel like a black box or require a deeper understanding of optimization and penalty terms.

Let’s be honest, most data scientists, economists, and analysts aren’t following the latest literature. A lot of them are still using the same tricks they learned two decades ago. And it’s not going to be the new guy with a “magic” optimization method who suddenly changes how things are done.

To give you an example of what counts as a “classical” modeling approach in practice. Back when I worked a government job, I had to practically battle with economists just to get them to consider using mixed models instead of a simple linear regression. Even when it was clearly the wrong tool for the data structure, they’d still lean on what they knew.

Why? Because it's familiar. Because it doesn’t attract attention. And because most people in the workplace aren't there to innovate, they're there to get the job done and keep their job secure. Change, especially when it comes from someone newer or using ""fancy"" methods, feels risky.

Not all problems are predictive analytics. “Data science” is so ambiguous that there are jobs that require classical statistic techniques to explain the relationship vs only performing data mining/machine learning. Many businesses want to know the why as well. Designed experiments can save businesses and organizations millions of dollars in potential waste. 

At least with fewer variables backwards or stepwise is often preferred. Hastie, one of the authors of ESL/ISL, argues to use forward for statistical learning (prediction) over the other two. He’s also responsible for furthering the optimization of ridge regression. 

Many statisticians won’t even automate it for experiments, but manually observe each layer. It’s also possible to be working with a domain expert like a research physician or engineer that will tell you a particular variable must be in the model. Ridge and elastic net ruin your ability to perform classical inference, while LASSO eliminates variables, it is biased.

Stepwise selection can be used on any type of model. As long as the final model is validated on data not used during model fit or feature selection (e.g. the “validate” set from a train/test/validate split, or the outer layer of a nested cross-validation), it should not yield biased results.

It may not be better than other feature selection techniques, such as exhaustive selection, genetic algorithms, shadow features (Boruta), importance filtering, or of course the painstaking application of domain knowledge.

It will basically ignore anything that isn’t useful and show you what variables it is pivoting on with specific “importance”.

New here, this may be long winded but any guidance would be amazing.

In my situation, what do you guys think I should ask for my title change to be? My position/title is due for a change in 3 months (They've explicitly informed me my title will likely change to align with the DS work I've been doing, but I have some input regarding this decision.) and the way we scope salaries is using different averages for that specific title for that specific area, in consideration with YOE, education, etc... I don't know really what the whole market is like ATM, and which title will give me more leverage on my resume going forward. They decided to invest in me while I was still an undergrad as a fulltime DE and if I worked out it'd just be trial by fire.

I'm currently a DE (salary 80k) with a bachelor's from a small school in the boot state at an ag-fi company, 2YOE. But my role has been heavily driven by DS. I've built our data platform (databricks focused) out from the ground up (from an empty Azure Resource Group) along with our DS Manager. He is a domain expert who is quite traditional and handles many of the visualizations and tableau/powerbi things, and while he doesn't model much, he has an amazing vision for where we need to focus next. However, he turns to me often for implementation and to go research and find things in the wild that are worth implementing that perhaps we don't yet have. Typically I end up cradle-to-graving the data process. But without him, I wouldn't be able to quickly identify/know where to point myself and begin drilling down with other teams. I'm grdually starting to better understand the domain, though.

My current thoughts are
1. MLE? (Applied MLE since no research?)
2. DS (Associate DS because of YOE?)
3. Full Stack DS (I see this pop up on LinkedIn, but it resonated a bit with me.. is it a title that is taken seriously?)
4. DE/DS/MLE/Python Web Dev/Infra Engineer/Backend Dev?
5. Junior Quant DS? (if that's even a real thing. I'm so focused on the work, my knowledge of the fields is lacking, and google will tell me just about anything exists, but whether that's actually a position seen in the wild in the market is different yknow)

I've ended up implementing some specific applied models (ARIMA, NBeats with exogenous vars, Koopman-inspired models utilizing DMD (Driven by Brunton and Kutz's writings), convolutional types like TimesFM, transformer TS, as well as a Linear Factor Model implementation that our quant tweaked and helped me with implementing. For any that were deployed, I also implemented champion-challenger/rudimentary mlops.
Against pre-existing baselines on out of sample data, things perform enough that they're happy, though I know my gaps in knowledge leave room to be desired. One of my implementations has helped generate around 200k. I've done some multiple linear regressions. But we have 2 research analysts where that's their bread and butter, and tbh they'd get a bit angry with me if I started to encroach on that and I'd like to keep the politics all friendly.
I've also done some motif exploration and set up a basic anomaly detection on sensor data using a matrix profile approach inspired by Eamonn Keough's UCR papers, though after talking with our quant, perhaps I should have used a kalman filter? Jury still out lol), Anytime Before I implement or deliver, I have to do a few whiteboard sessions breaking down how the models work to a director( phd quant ) and the DSM.
Lately I've been building risk analysis pipelines on countries, and 80% of my time hsa been working on a full stack flask app that's going to be the the new data owner for some very specific risk-related customer tracking and analytics. I've created and deployed all the resources from scratch in Azure with Terraform, devops pipelines, or azure cli, assigned the roles, implemented Entra ID, built the data model, and now I'm serving the data I've been building pipelines for. We just hired an intern who will help take some of my responsibilities in DE as long as he works out, but I will retain many of my hats that I currently wear.

The supplementary studying eats up my evenings, but I feel like without it, I wouldn't be able to keep up haha. I also still work a second job in retail to help with my student loans.

Currently, I'm a little over halfway through Elements of Statistical Learning By Tibshirani and Hastie, also been looking at the underlying principles that drive bayesian networks, with a goal in converting certain deterministic models into probabilistic ones. After this, I'm looking to better understand GARCH(I know it is predicated on heteroschedasticity which I've become more familiar with, but not much past that tbh) and VaR for some pipelines I'm anticipating in the near future. After that will probably be an interactive timetabling app for logistics, that I haven't read up on very much yet.

But like, say a title pays less in my specific area's market (I'll just have to research based off the recommendations), but gives me more leverage in applications processes or increases my appeal (I understand nothing will raise my appeal until I get a masters. Looking at that next year or two after paying off student loans).
I know it sounds lazy, or like I didn't research what this role should be called, but I'm so all over the place idk where to start and what would just be confirmation bias or me misinterpreting things, etc... There aren't really any Data Scientists where I'm at and I don't have anybody in my circle I can ask. It feels more overwhelming than the work itself, haha.

Something like what Galvanize Data Science used to offer, but for people who are working. I'm not looking for things like DataCamp, though I do think that direction is valid.

This Fall I will be beginning my undergrad in Data Analytics at Ohio State University.

OSU does not offer a Data Science program, but nonetheless it is my best option, so I am content with Data Analytics.

mmv8txo,1jy2pe0,mcjon77,"You are going to be at a massive disadvantage, especially since your experience didn't have the title data scientist. It's likely that for any large corporations you won't even get past the hiring manager. 

You're dealing with a convergence of two things. First there's been a shrinking of entry level data scientist positions compared to 5 years ago. At the same time there's been an explosion of data science and analytics masters degree programs. So you're entering a market with fewer open positions and more qualified applicants. 

The big issue is that, while a hiring manager might look at your experience and understand how it relates to a data scientist position, they're likely never going to see your application. It's the purpose of HR to filter out applications that don't meet the standards. Positions are very often getting a thousand applications. 95% are dropped automatically because they don't meet a qualification, often Visa status, but also experience. 

Let's say the HR rep gets 30 resumes of folks with a master's degree or more. Why would she add your resume to that list of resumes that she sends to the hiring manager when she probably doesn't even understand how your experience even applies? She's in human resources, not data science, so if the job listed on your resume doesn't say data scientist she won't know how it's related.  

She also can't send the hiring manager every single resume that might qualify, because her whole job is to filter out resumes and the hiring manager doesn't have time to go through or 200 resumes themself.

Ironically enough, you're a great candidate for a data science master's degree. I was in a similar situation. I had 3 years experience as a data analyst and wanted to make the transition, so I picked up a data science master's degree.

There are perhaps two options for the BS
1) There are companies that want to hire a bachelors because they don’t wanna spend the money on a PhD or someone with significant experience so they might have a slot for a true entry-level position. This would be a junior position working under senior people. A guy I mentored is a BS from a good but not top  School and he is working at Amazon.  I know several recent BS grads that work at Deloitte and Accenture. 

2) Another option are firms that have lighter data requirements and heavy requirements in the subject matter field. I work in Pharma and this is common.  We have departments loaded with BS data analysts. In science based industries, a combination of the subject matter and the data is where the power comes from so in a lot of cases these companies are fine with pairing BS data people with PhD physical scientists

technically no, a masters isn't *always* necessary, especially with 3 years of relevant experience. lots of people break in without one. but lets be real, its tough out there rn and that ""masters preferred"" thing is often a filter hr uses when they get slammed with applications. it gives them an easy way to cut down the pile, even if its kinda arbitrary.

since you have solid experience, maybe the issue is *how* its presented on your resume? like, are you really highlighting the data science *impact* and using the right keywords? sometimes not having the exact ""data scientist"" title means you need to work harder to show your skills match up. got a portfolio? github projects showing off your skills can help alot too. sometimes that speaks louder than a degree checkbox.

the online masters just for the paper is tempting, i get it. it *might* help get past that initial screening. but its still cash and time, right? maybe try really focusing on tailoring your resume/cover letter for each role first? quantify everything you can. networking can also sometimes bypass the initial hr filter if you can get a referral.

1. Have portfolio projects.  
Not having any is a big red flag for this level. Added bonus if you're scraping your own data instead of fitting some sklearn classifier to a pre-cleaned Kaggle set.

2. There are other ways of getting the ""data scientist"" title. 

\- Freelance/consulting work for small businesses that are okay with you using their name on your resume

\- Volunteer orgs. I volunteered as a data scientist for multiple orgs and included that on my resume

\- Horizontal, internal moves: It's more important to do data science work than to be a titled a data scientist. Try to get projects where you can gain experience. And eventually you may be able to move into that position within your own company.

3. Have a portfolio website. 

This is more common for CS jobs, but having a portfolio site will help you stand out from the pile in data science apps or when reaching out to recruiters. Only 7% of people actually do this.

From my experience (applying to many DS jobs and getting rejected), most DS jobs look for direct experience, and scientific/statistical training. So doing a masters with a data focused project or having a masters in science where you get formal stat training is very helpful. 

The science in DS is somewhat misunderstood: research, drawing hypotheses, preforming experiments, understanding data and presenting are really essential and form the basis of a masters, along with the stats needed to do data analysis and hypothesis testing.

Even if you don't don't need these skills for a DS role (debatable), this a still a major hiring criteria.

mn3aeh5,1jxtzs1,BrisklyBrusque,"In insurance, risk is often modeled using GLMs. The outcome variable is usually claim amount, claim frequency, loss ratio, loss ratio relativity, or some other measure of loss. Interestingly, the outcome variable tends to be highly skewed. Think Auto insurance for example: maybe 1 out of every 25 policyholders reports a claim in a given accident year. A few claims are small, a small number of claims are big, and a very small (but expensive) fraction are exceptionally big. And so the outcome variable is often modeled using a Tweedie distribution, which is a simple zero-inflated continuous distribution.

How we transform and massage the data can have a lot of impact. Capping outliers, scaling variables, and using imputation or credibility weighting (an actuarial technique) are some good tricks.

More advanced teams are using GAMs, Boosting, ensembles, neural networks, bootstrap regression, regularized regression, etc. For models that are filed with the Dept. of Insurance, GLMs are often preferred because models subject to DOI auditing have to be explainable. For rating and retention models, black boxes are OK, and more teams are using SHAP values for interpretation.

Do the data need to be time series? Not always. Sometimes, you can simply use each policy term (one year of data and one year of exposure) as a row in the training data. However, you may have a competitive advantage by adding trends to the data (for example, computing the trending average loss over a four year span and including it as a predictor).",3,1744650531.0

mmuyz5f,1jxtzs1,EstablishmentDry1074,"Hey there! It sounds like you're diving into some interesting topics in the financial sector. For fraud detection and risk modeling, there are a few areas you might want to focus on. Common techniques include anomaly detection, supervised and unsupervised learning models, and statistical methods like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Since you’re proficient in causal inference and statistical tests, you’re already on the right track!

In the context of fraud detection, common methods like outlier detection and clustering techniques (e.g., k-means) are often used, alongside time series anomaly detection for detecting fraudulent activity over time. Models like XGBoost or CatBoost have gained popularity due to their performance in classification tasks. It’s also important to understand feature engineering and how to deal with imbalanced datasets, since fraud data is often highly skewed.

Risk modeling can involve techniques like Value at Risk (VaR), credit scoring, and Monte Carlo simulations. Depending on the role, you might need to get familiar with how these models integrate with financial data systems.

In practice, anomaly detection often comes up in fraud detection, so methods like Z-score, ARIMA, and SARIMA are used in time series, but you may also encounter more advanced approaches like Isolation Forest or autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection.

They most likely are wrong but could be directionally accurate and worth doing. They are likely wrong because they attempt to oversimplify a very complicated reality. Take adstocking for example you know that’s not how brand awareness and the funnel truly plays out… “oops it’s been 52 weeks I forgot what Allstate insurance is!” However, there really isn’t an obvious alternative to create this package of insights without conducting experiments. As someone else pointed out when companies spend big budgets it can really drive a high impact. 

Speculating but if the model doesn’t have reasonable controls (non-marketing variables) and it is Bayesian linear regression then expect a very strong reliance on the priors to get the data to conform to the “business intuition”.

mmsm4ng,1jxdlfg,techdaddykraken,"I strongly believe in product-first marketing.

Marketing itself is a stochastic process reliant on non-deterministic outputs.

There are niche areas where it is possible to identify true causal relationships, such as an e-commerce only vertical with end-to-end tracking for revenue and engagement. 

But by and large when you talk about large-scale marketing operations that involve different aspects of paid search, SEO, web development, display advertising, out-of-home advertising, remarketing, etc, it quickly becomes a system that is more noise than signal.

Explaining the in’s and out’s of the system’s mechanics to stakeholders falls on deaf ears. When you try to explain probability theory, data structures, learning models, all they want to do is argue over details they don’t understand, because their confirmation bias usually drives their decision-making. (I THINK this is the best way to do marketing, or I THINK we can find a solution under this budget figure, or I THINK we can hit this metric goal). Very often the stakeholders who do this, are not part of the marketing dynamic. They are an operations director looking from the outside-in, a CEO, a finance VP, etc.

For a wide variety of reasons, the methods that most companies use to perform marketing are backwards and illogical. It’s an environment full of noise, circular reasoning, fallacies, biases, and internal politics.

This can be said the same for most departments in most companies, but I believe marketing gets the worst of these actions, because for large part they allow it. My pet theory is that the marketing industry has not done enough to standardize the education pathway into a licensed profession, as well as marketing individuals being more timid and complicit. 

All of these concepts culminate in a marketing department at most companies where results are just guesses driven by vibes and poorly formed conclusions. 

For those reasons, I don’t believe in ‘data-driven marketing’. I’m a firm believer that you shouldn’t look at the data at all. 

Thought experiment: would Steve Jobs have designed the original MacBook any differently if he had a team of marketers analyzing past results from Google Ads and Google Analytics to identify the products which consumers liked the best and were more likely to purchase?

I don’t think he would have, nor should he have. I think he would’ve told them to kick rocks, and he would’ve gone on to build the MacBook how he envisioned.

Today? I think most companies get so caught up in the enamor of what marketing should be as an ideal. They want the pretty, neat, organized marketing that is tied up in a bow, and gives them the exact results they want and predict.

Unless they are equally willing to invest in the educational and technological components to make that vision a reality, they are more likely to continuously fail than not. 

Time and again I have seen companies attempt to perform ‘data-driven marketing’ without even having a dedicated data engineer on staff for data wrangling and cleaning. Or having a dedicated BI solution, instead each performance marketer is using separate solutions in a disjoint manner. Or having standardized data dictionaries for data sources and calculation methodologies. Or ensuring stakeholders take basic courses in statistics and data science so that they can understand common terminology.

To that end, I believe a group of educated, experienced, intelligent individuals, using round-table discussions to drive innovation, is the best way to perform marketing today. It removes all of the external noise and focuses solely on your human experience as the driver for your decision-making. 

I don’t need data to tell me that the majority of working class Americans are stretched to the brink in terms of their finances. Many forgoing meals, dental work, basic household repairs, and taking on debt just to survive. I don’t need data to tell me that we’re in the midst of a fascist takeover, with our president using the institutions of our government to enrich him and his cabinet.

I don’t need data to tell me that China is quickly overtaking the U.S. in nearly all areas as they relate to economic growth and prosperity. 

I don’t need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are propagandized through social media. I don’t need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are under-educated and have an inflated sense of self-worth compared to the rest of the world due to incentivized nationalism over the past century.

I don’t need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are getting subpar nutrition due to corporations putting toxins in our food and water supply.

But God forbid you bring these points up in a marketing meeting, every stakeholder will give you the stink-eye and escort you out, because it doesn’t fit their picture-perfect version of marketing, where their stable of meek marketers timidly comply with their biased decisions, acting as their personal ‘go-fers’ to fetch them more leads on demand whenever the numbers on the charts don’t live up to their unrealistic expectations.

Most forms of marketing innovation fail due to external stakeholder pressure, not a lack of ability to innovate using skills or a lack of technology/budget.

Instead of paying a team of data scientists for advanced modeling, that money would be FAR better spent, from a return on investment perspective, in educating core stakeholders on the basic mechanics of how modern technology works from a networking, algorithm, data structure  perspective, and how probability theory and basic statistics work, as well as the psychographic principles which influence most human behavior.

doing that, will lead to far greater returns for marketing investment, than trying to implement complex modeling beyond your means.",-1,1744491720.0

mmhb1zg,1jwbevk,enteringinternetnow,"Here are some key skills for a DS. I’ll start with the basics as you asked specific to DS who are just starting out -

1. Understand the problem you’re working on well: most entry level DS are guilty of it. They jump directly into the modeling part without much understanding of the problem & data. Spend a bit of time in this step to make sure you understand the problem well. 

2. Exploratory data analysis: this is another key skill that doesn’t get as much attention. Do a whole bunch of EDA to understand the data. Understanding the data well helps you build better models.


3. Flawless pipelines: Make sure you’re able to write pipeline codes without errors. For example, ensure there are no duplications in your workflows & do sense testing on every step. Double check your work always!!

These are a bit more advanced ones: 

4. Domain knowledge: this is the absolute most crucial thing in my opinion and most DS are oblivious to. Knowledge of the domain helps you understand the problem you’re working on, use the right features & story tell what your model is doing. This in my opinion makes a “full stack data scientist” 

5. Storytelling: explaining & convincing the stakeholders on why they should use your (models’) recommendations. Having domain skills helps you tell the right story. PowerPoint skills + communication are the essentials here. A linear regression that’s explained well has a better chance of acceptance than a deep neural net with ensembling & RAG deployed on the cloud with poor storytelling.

You're right that the ""full-stack data scientist"" has become more myth than reality — most real-world DS roles now require specialization + some business context rather than doing everything end to end. But IMO, the survivability of your skillset long-term comes down to one thing:

👉 Are you close to the signal?

By that I mean:

* Are you building or interpreting models that directly impact decisions or outcomes?
* Are your outputs measurable, valuable, and ideally hard to replace by vanilla AI/automation?

That could be in product analytics, ML modeling, recommender systems, etc. It doesn’t really matter which domain as long as:

1. You're close to action (not just cleaning or wiring data)
2. You can speak both model and business
3. You're hands-on enough to experiment and deploy

From what I’ve seen (including in places like [CrunchDAO](https://crunchdao.com), where people get paid based on how well their models perform — not their title), people who can interpret data *and* own model outcomes tend to thrive regardless of role type.

Your product DS friends and your data eng friends are both partly right. But the long-term moat isn’t in tools — it’s in:

* Thinking in hypotheses
* Designing solid experiments
* Building explainable, testable models
* And being able to adapt when the tools change (because they always will)

So no, you’re not overthinking. You’re thinking just enough — just don’t get stuck in a “which tool pays more” mindset. Go deep in one area that’s close to value, stay curious, and you’ll be fine.",2,1744620403.0

mn962pb,1jwbevk,EnoughIzNuf,"Hey OP, good question! It's definitely a lot to think about, especially with AI changing so fast.

Ngl, both your Product DS and DE friends kinda have points. Knowing some cloud/SWE basics is super useful even if you're not a pure engineer, 'cause models gotta run *somewhere*. And yeah, DE tools change, but understanding *why* you're building the pipeline (the biz/product side) is crucial too.

So, which technical skillset is gonna be most valuable? Honestly, it's tough to pick *one* winner.

1. **Data Engineering fundamentals** (ETL/ELT thinking, data modeling, cloud infra basics, SQL wizardry) are probably gonna stick around. Tools change, but the *need* for clean, reliable data pipelines isn't going anywhere. Someone's gotta build and maintain the foundation.
2. **Solid ML/Stats knowledge** (beyond just `model.fit()`) is also key. Think understanding *why* models work, how to evaluate them properly, experimental design, causal inference. AI might automate basic model building, but interpreting results, designing good experiments, and understanding limitations? That's human insight.
3. **Cloud skills** are becoming table stakes across the board. Doesn't mean you need to be a cloud architect, but knowing your way around AWS/GCP/Azure for data storage, processing, and maybe basic model deployment is huge.

The ""full stack"" thing might be fading for *entry-level*, but having T-shaped skills (deep in one area, broad awareness in others) is golden. A DE who understands ML workflows, or an analyst who knows how data gets ingested? Super valuable.

**TL;DR:** You're not totally overthinking it, but don't get paralyzed. Strong fundamentals in SQL, Python, stats/ML principles, and basic cloud literacy seem like the most durable bets across *most* paths. AI will likely automate simpler tasks in *all* areas, pushing folks towards more complex problem-solving.

Leaning into what genuinely interests you is probably the best move long-term, 'cause you'll need to constantly learn anyway. Just make sure you're building those solid fundamentals along the way! Good luck!",1,1744733377.0
mn97la7,1jwbevk,crowcanyonsoftware,"You're not overthinking—it’s a smart question, especially in this AI-flavored economy where the ""most employable"" skillset keeps shifting. Here's the distilled take:

**1. Business sense is the moat—now what complements it best?**  
Assuming you’ve got business context down (as you said), the edge comes from being able to *deliver insights at scale*. That means:

* **Data fluency (SQL, Python, basic stats) is table stakes.**
* **Cloud + software fundamentals** (e.g., Git, Docker, basic CI/CD, using AWS/GCP) offer serious leverage—even if you don’t build pipelines daily, knowing how things are deployed makes you more collaborative and valuable.
* **Communication and storytelling** will always beat pure technical flash.

**2. Data engineering vs. product DS: both are valid paths, with tradeoffs.**

* **Product DS** = closer to decision-making, faster feedback loops, good if you like experimentation and being in the “why it matters” zone.
* **Data Engineering** = deeper infrastructure, slower iteration, but scalable impact and often more job openings—especially in AI teams feeding LLMs or real-time systems.

**3. AI and tooling abstraction is real.** You’re right to be wary of building deep expertise in tools that get abstracted. So rather than mastering a specific stack, focus on:

* **Problem-solving frameworks** (e.g., causal inference, experiment design, pipeline design).
* **Learning how to learn** new tools quickly (most companies want adaptability, not tool memorization).
* **Keeping an eye on AI integration**—knowing how to plug models into pipelines or use vector databases, for instance, is already proving valuable.

**4. Long-term resilience? Probably hybrid profiles.** The most resilient data scientists tomorrow will likely be:

* Conversant in ML and engineering (not necessarily expert).
* Able to ship experiments or prototypes.
* Good at translating technical findings into strategy.

So, your instincts are spot on: specialize, but stay general enough to adapt. Pick what interests you most *within* those growing zones. If you lean product DS, sharpen cloud + software fundamentals. If you're drawn to engineering, build that, but stay in touch with business and ML needs.

mmk5zwf,1jwlf3f,Cuidads,"Demand forecasting doesn’t typically require causal inference, so I’m curious what specific problem you are trying to solve.

Are you trying to estimate the effect of an action, like a price change or a marketing campaign, on demand? That would be a causal question. But causal inference is not a predictive tool. It is used to isolate the impact of interventions, and doing it properly requires strong domain knowledge to correctly handle confounders, colliders, and the overall causal structure. It is also brittle. If you get the assumptions wrong, your conclusions can be worse than doing nothing.

In short, causal inference is not a drop-in replacement for forecasting. It addresses a different type of question. Do not chase a buzzword without a clear problem that justifies it.

I am going to go out on a limb here. Based on what you wrote, and the fact that you did not include any specifics, I would advise against taking this on right now. As a junior, you likely do not yet have the statistical grounding or domain context to drive this kind of methodological shift. Most likely, the senior folks will hear your pitch, quietly realize it lacks depth, and politely disregard it. Not because you spoke up, but because it will signal that you do not yet fully understand either forecasting or causal inference.

That does not mean you should not contribute ideas. You absolutely should. But choose your timing carefully. Do not spend your credibility on a big pivot that you are not ready to defend.",24,1744378197.0
mmp6q4c,1jwlf3f,Professional_Push_20,"If the current demand model forecasting isn’t performing well, a good starting hypothesis is that the features don’t fully capture the drivers of demand. 

Thinking the demand drivers through as a casual inference problem can be a great way to develop a deep and shared understanding of the domain. 

But start simply and don’t get technical early: simply spending some time with some people who are domain experts sketching out a ‘drivers tree’ i.e. ‘what drives what’ may be all you need. 

You only need to get more technical if the domain experts don’t have a full picture that allows you identify the right features. At that point, you can focus on where the ambiguity or uncertainty lies and suggest causal inference approaches to figure it out. 

Starting simply and practically will help bring people on the journey with you. It unlikely anyone will object to you speaking time to understand the domain and features. They might object to you going down a technical route that is very new to you.

Finally, keep in mind that for forecasting, you don’t have to understand cause and effect — correlation can be enough to forecast. It just needs to work.",6,1744443576.0
mmq2ewx,1jwlf3f,mentalist16,"I lost access to the causal inference POV I prepared for a similar usecase. Sharing the only notes I have left remaining:

1.      Causal Inference

o   Unlike predictive inference (where given the cause you predict the outcome), causal inference is concerned with why, if, and to what extent a cause leads to an outcome. Example: Whether a particular drug cured an illness – if yes then how effective it was, or if no then what other factors might have cured it.

o   Potential Outcomes refer to all possible outcomes to a situation. Generally, Y(0) refers to outcome when treatment was not applied, while Y(1) refers to outcome when it was applied. “Treatment” is the cause we are interested in, like taking a drug, applying a marketing strategy etc. It is impossible to observe both Y(0) and Y(1), so we cannot measure the exact impact of treatment Y(1) – Y(0). However, we can measure the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) = E\[Y(1) – Y(0)\].

o   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) are a way to visualize causal inference. In DAG, nodes are directed and a previously traversed nodes cannot be revisited (hence acyclic). DAG allows to map the series of causal steps that led to the outcome.",3,1744461473.0

Another step is to plot it against your target variable - does the relationship look linear? If it's non-linear, maybe you need to apply a transformation for your model to be able to capture the relationship. If your variable is integers with a relatively small range and there isn't a clear relationship with the target variable, maybe you should treat it as categorical. How correlated is it with other variables? Does its product with any other variable have a strong correlation with the target? Maybe you need an interaction feature.

mm3qi78,1juo7ue,enteringinternetnow,"Good points, OP! MOST interviews don’t test the really “advanced” / “flashy new thing” concepts. Because most companies don’t need that yet. Everyone is going to test the foundations to see if they’re strong. If you have it, you can easily learn the advanced ones. 

In my opinion, these are the foundations

1. SQL - joins, window functions, subqueries, query optimization
2. Database design - applies to more structured data
3. Statistics - distributions, CLT, confidence intervals, inferences - R2, p value, z value etc. 
4. Probability - conditional probability 
5. ML theory - least squares, logistical regression, VIF, variable selection, model selection, cross validation/resampling, classification - confusion matrix, bias variance tradeoff
6. Practical ML - regularization/scaling, missing values handling, outlier detection
7. Coding 

These are the most broad topics. Could be different for specific industries (NLP, social network modeling etc) 

Good luck!",79,1744146650.0

My 2 cents, good luck.",2,1744204069.0

I recommend the following courses in high school:

* Calculus III (you might have to take it from a university. I took a course from my Alma mater in high school)
* AP Macroeconomics
* AP Microeconomics
* AP Statistics
* AP Computer Science

College:

* Enroll in statistics and computer science dual degree or even statistics and economics with a focus in data science
* Courses
   * Discrete Mathematics
   * Linear Algebra
   * Statistics courses should focus on data science, programming in Python and Machine Learning
   * Econometrics (make sure there is some programming)
   * Computer Science (focus in data science)

Internships

* Apply to internships as early as you can
* Work on personal projects or even volunteer doing data analysis for non-profit or business
* Get a part time job in college to earn extra money and work experience
* Work as a research assistant doing data science work.
   * In my senior year, I was helping a PhD student with statistical analysis. I got course credit and experience to land my first job after graduation.

Networking

* Network with data science professionals as early as you can to understand the industry
* Join local data science meetup groups in your area to learn new technologies",2,1744212512.0
mm7e4k0,1jv4xqf,triggerhappy5,"You're a junior in high school. Enjoy high school, study hard, get into college and choose the cheapest option that is still pretty good (CC for 1-2 years, then transfer in-state is probably the smartest way to go about it). Do computer science, statistics, mathematics, or something along those lines. Try to get an undergrad internship if you can, a good GPA and networking is what you need the most for this.

I have never seen a data science position that was open to a high school grad, and I would say most of the good ones are looking for a Master's or PhD. So grad school is going to be the real thing that matters, and you'll want to make sure you aren't in debt after undergrad, and that you have good grades to get into a good program. GT and UT have great, cheap online MS programs, obviously Berkeley, MIT, Stanford are kind of a level above but much more expensive. If you did the right things in undergrad, you can get grants that will pay for a whole PhD at a lot of these schools (but it is highly competitive, so 3.8+ GPA, 170 quant GRE, and undergrad internships or research is a must). 

For now, like I said, just have fun and focus on learning, not trying to build your resume. And FWIW, specifically regarding that path, learning the math early is gonna be essential for understanding the logic behind coding and data structures, so I wouldn't think too much about that path and just focus on the curriculum offered by your high school and then college.",2,1744203820.0
mm7dn4g,1jv4xqf,Chaoticgaythey,"Most data scientists I know have engineering or statistics heavy degrees (STEM, some econ, social science, and similar). Datascience as a field is extremely broad. Figure out what general area you'd want to be in (finance is always training juniors and profitable, but has lower salary caps than tech, tech isn't always profitable and experiences layoffs, but hashigher income usually, healthcare is really stable and sometimes pays well, but you might be working for an insurance company screwing people out of healthcare, and adtech is just kind of soulless, but has lots of exit opportunities).

Once you generally have an idea for which section you want, try to find what degrees will get you there:
Engineering (ChE and EE have a lot of transferable analytics and modeling in my experience) will open doors in most roles except for a handful of healthcare jobs while various degrees tend to be a bit more field specific. Remember that field specific knowledge is extremely valuable as a datascientist.

You'll probably want at least a masters (eventually). Some roles generally need a PhD, but I really wouldn't say to do one unless you won't hate the 5-7+ years of grinding for it. You can usually start as an analyst and get valuable experience with a BS though. 

For skills, try to take some programming classes along the way and do programming related projects/research/internships. The more you can show competency the easier the search will be. I never formally learned SQL but it was fairly easy to figure out on my own. Make sure you learn a bit about cloud computing (I use Spark a lot which let's Python and SQL kind of blend together).

It'll be a lot of work. Make sure it's really what you want. I'd say a lot of us kind of end up here unintentionally, but we also ended up on this track before DataScience(tm) really was a thing.",1,1744203647.0

You don't need to rush into R unless you're particularly curious—Python is already widely used in data science. SQL is also super important, so learning how to query databases should be high on your list too.

Internships are harder to come by at the high school level, but try local universities, startups, or even volunteering for research projects.

Btw if I were you I would also be a little cautious about using AI to learn all of this.

mm88gta,1jv4xqf,trustsfundbaby,"To answer your questions:

1. Typically no. But for a highschooler it could be beneficial for trying to find an internship. A lot of people think they can get ""certified"" in data science or data analytics and you can't. Its like saying you can get ""certified"" to be a mathematician, you can. You have to get a college degree or have many years of work experience/published research.

2. Normally getting an internship as a highschooler is rare, at least I don't remember anyone getting on when I was in highschool 15 years ago. I've also never seen a highschool intern anywhere I've worked. Best place to look are the companies career page/indeed/LinkedIn. Most internship postings get published at the start of fall semester so the companies can find who they want for summer. So look around mid August and apply regardless of lack of experience or what year you are in college.

3. I personally believe most online ""road to data scientist"" programs are scams, even if they are free. They act like this path is linear. It is not. You will learn all these tools (sql, python, math) at the same time. They also act like you can learn everything in a year. You cannot. Think about everything you had to learn to get to doing basic calculus. Now you are stepping into a field where calculus is one of the basic concept you must apply. College will teach you everything you need to know to get started. If you want to get started now learn python and use the open source libraries like scikit-learn as a black box to make ML models.",1,1744213253.0
mm8dduv,1jv4xqf,DisgustingCantaloupe,"There are many paths to data science because there is a lot of variability in what a data science role looks like... However I would say the bar for becoming a data scientist is getting higher as the field becomes more mature.

Full-stop, I would not waste your money on certifications or boot-camps. There was a time when the data scientist field was first beginning where that was a viable path, but I don't think it is any longer. Industry is typically looking for people with a high degree of expertise and experience for data science roles.

A bachelor's degree in a related field like statistics, data science, or computer science is not even sufficient in many cases. If you're lucky and/or really stand-out from the crowd with published research as well as internships then you may be able to land a data scientist job with a bachelor's alone. I've known one person personally who was able to land a DS job through an internship he did during undergrad.

A master's degree and PhD is a better bet these days. That was the entry-level threshold at both places I've been hired (the only exceptions were very exceptional BS holders but they were very rare).

Undergrad majors you should choose from are statistics, data science (if available), and computer science. Bonus points if you double-major. Ensure you're taking the necessary math and probability/statistics courses that you'd need to prep you for a solid graduate program (linear algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Experimental Design, Regression).

Pick your undergrad program wisely. You want to find a program that has a track record of empowering the undergrad students to complete substantial research projects that lead to conference presentations and journal publications. The program should also have a track record of its students finding relevant internships (the program will often help match students with local internship opportunities).",1,1744214696.0

Data science is still a new field and it's a very broad one so I would suggest you look at studying computer science, software engineering or statistics over an actual data science program for your primary study, but pick the areas that interest you most in data science (ie, deep learning, forecasting, NLP) for additional courses and training. 

Do not get a BS in Data Science. You'll be competing with the CS majors for some roles and with stats majors for other roles.

There is no certification in data science that is an industry standard, and for that matter there's no standard analyst cert that has the same weight as a CCNA. Your portfolio of projects you've done and how you can speak to it will matter most. I've been in the field a decade, have management experience but I haven't gotten past a phone screen because I don't have that specific experience the company is looking for, ie they want five years of time series or three years of GenAI application development, etc. 

As for internships, most internships I've seen are for grad students or PhD candidates. I've offered one for a high school student when I was at a prior company but that was an example of nepotism (CDO's nephew wanted a job) rather than anything that aligned with company goals.

A lot of companies that went fully remote during the pandemic have since shifted to hybrid (even if it’s mostly for optics or control). That said, there *are* still fully remote roles out there—especially in smaller companies, startups, and international orgs.



Some tips that have worked for me or people I know:

• **Use filters aggressively** on sites like [Wellfound (ex AngelList)](https://wellfound.com) or **remote-friendly job boards** like We Work Remotely, RemoteOK, or Otta. You’ll still need to dig through the noise, but there are solid finds.

• **Search for companies, not jobs.** Build a list of companies that are known for remote-first culture (e.g., GitLab, Automattic, Zapier) and check their careers pages directly.

• **Reddit and Discord** communities sometimes surface openings before they hit job boards. Look at r/datasciencejobs, r/remotejs (not just JS), or niche Discords.

• **Referrals still matter.** A lot of remote jobs are not widely posted—internal or network-based hires are common. If you can, post your interest in relevant forums with your skillset.



And yeah, LinkedIn’s filters are honestly pretty bad right now for finding *truly* remote roles. You’re not imagining that.

But they do still exist. The trick is looking where remote-first cultures already thrive *and* where the value of the role isn’t location-dependent.

Here’s a few spots that are way better than LinkedIn noise:

Better places to check:

* We Work Remotely – Data Jobs
* Remotive.io – Data Science
* RemoteOK (but you gotta filter aggressively)
* AngelList Talent (search by “Remote”, filter for early-stage startups)
* \[AI/ML job boards on Discords like ML Collective, Cerebral Valley, Latent Space etc.\]

Bonus tip:  
Instead of job boards, look at platforms where *earning = performance*, not hours or office presence.

I know a bunch of folks supplement or replace remote work through places like:

* [CrunchDAO](https://crunchdao.com): ML competition w/ $USDC rewards (no resumes, async)
* Numerai: Similar vibe, model-based earnings
* \[Kaggle competitions + freelance gigs on Upwork, Toptal, etc.\]

You see, with hiring and interviews of juniors I really like to give the them the floor and that opportunity to present it and if you do this with passion, there is nothing more captivating than that. In this field we deal with a lot of stakeholders so if you can simply explain the problem statement, your motivation, the different methods you used and why and the impact then super! 

Now I could give you some pointers and talk about a few projects you could do related to, let’s say, predictive analytics where you can show off some time series analyses, data visualization, or something with segmentation using clustering to cover feature engineering and some unsupervised learning, or even a sentiment analysis with some cool NLP techniques and data mining methods for modeling but for me at least if you have a project that you pour your heart into and tell a story, you’ll be set, stakeholders eat this shit up. 

Another tip is it also helps a lot when the project in question is tied to relevant domain knowledge in the industry you are breaking into but overall, demonstrating the application of your project, the obstacles you found, and some of the out-of-the-box thinking methods (i.e engineering new and better features based off existing features to better categorize your data for increased accuracy*) various models/approaches you tried to overcome the problem statements and then the insights for that sort of value then you are golden my friend 🙏


* One of the projects I worked on involved building a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. Simple stuff right and people would roll their eyes on this one ;) The goal was to incorporate a wide range of features that could influence the price, including factors like square footage, the number of bedrooms/ bathrooms, floors, and many others. In total, the dataset consisted of approximately 63 features, covering every conceivable attribute of a house.

During the data exploration phase, I noticed that one particular feature – the age of the house – seemed to have a significant impact on the model’s performance. This observation prompted me to dig deeper, and after conducting extensive research, I discovered an interesting legal aspect related to the geography of the houses I was analyzing.

Specifically, I found that in that particular region, any house older than 120 years was classified as a heritage site as per the law, which afforded it protection and often led to a higher valuation. This insight revealed that these heritage houses were consistently overvalued compared to non-heritage properties of similar characteristics and talking about this diagnostic to explain the why really did wonders in my presentation.

Realizing the importance of this factor, I engineered a new feature specifically to identify heritage houses within the dataset. Incorporating this feature into the model really improved its accuracy. So hopefully this all gives you an idea my friend",123,1744058150.0

With 1 year of experience, I wouldn’t expect groundbreaking research or deep stacks of production ML. What I’d actually love to see is:

🔹 **End-to-end thinking.**  
You saw a problem, explored the data, built something useful (even if small), and made a recommendation or shipped it.

🔹 **Clarity > Complexity.**  
Clean code, clean narrative. If you can walk me through your choices clearly, that’s more impressive than 20 features and 5 models you barely understand.

🔹 **Curiosity.**  
Did you go beyond the notebook? Try something experimental? Challenge assumptions? Use a tool like SHAP to explain something? These things stand out.

🔹 **Business awareness.**  
Even if it’s a side project, tell me *why* it mattered. Bonus points if you measured outcomes (even hypothetically).

Tbh, I'd rather see **2–3 tight, real-ish projects** than a huge GitHub of messy notebooks.

Also, don’t sleep on competitions like [CrunchDAO](https://hub.crunchdao.com/competitions/datacrunch#quickstarter-notebook) or Kaggle. They’re a great way to show you can work with structured data under real constraints, even without a big-name company on your resume.

mlytlmp,1ju139m,etherealcabbage72,"In the US at least, senior DS roles tend to fall into either technical leadership or people leadership. 

If you have an established reputation for producing results and prefer a people leadership role, I wouldn’t worry about keeping up to date with the latest technical advancements at a super rigorous level. For what it’s worth, managers of 10+ years at my company haven’t written a line of code in years but are great at connecting the dots business-wise. There is always demand for this type of person at the higher levels of an org. 

I also don’t think you’d be pigeonholing yourself by taking the Head role. The skills you learn in a job like that will be highly transferable to other companies even if the domain isn’t finance/FP&A.

I work in the finance department. Corporate accounting and financial reporting to be specific. I have a decent understanding of Advanced Excel, VBA scripting, Macros, PowerBI and learning Python, SQL etc. Even myself trying to escape finance department and make a career change to data analytics or data science. I work very closely with FPMs, the controller and other leaders in the organization. 

FP&A, accounting, Treasury aka the whole finance department is a very old fashioned and regulated profession. It could be very boring and countless long hours. Nowadays this profession is modernizing a bit with newer ERPs such as Oracle NetSuite, Fusion, SAP, Workday etc. and leveraging data analytics tools such as PowrBI tableau, SQL database but overall it could be very tedious, boring and feel outdated. 

If you have a good understanding of general ledger, trial balance, balance sheet, P&L, budgeting & forecasting, cashflow etc. and like to jump back into the domain then this is completely a personal choice but I wouldn't do it. I would say you have to consider the pros and cons. 

- The finance department is considered a cost center and most employees are underpaid if you compare it to other departments. 

- Burnout is a real thing in the finance department. Many people would like to get out of this department . We often talk about how little we get paid considering amount of long hours we put in. We compare ourselves with other departments and we say literally we make peanuts 

-  There are endless processes and controls because it's a regulated profession

- oftentimes you feel outdated as you are not connected to the technology world and your world revolves around financial data

- Finance department is old fashioned but some level of job security is there 

- If you are good with ML, Deep learning then I'm not sure how much of it you will use in your finance job.

- please do research on Pay Scale as it will be a major factor later in career

mn85mod,1ju139m,parthmaul,"I actually went through a very similar transition (and back again), so hopefully this helps. 

**Career Trajectory**

If 100% of your scope is truly SQL/BI-driven analysis and forecasting then you might find your other DS skills atrophying unless you supplement with special projects or self-guided learning. For example, you could really lean into the forecasting component of the role and try learning some advanced methods. In practice, this can be difficult to do depending on the demands of your defined scope.

When you say pure DS, if you mean running a product analytics, marketing science, and/or ML-focused team(s), then I would say this role won’t necessarily set you up for the next Head of DS/ML position. With that, it won’t hurt either! I would not view this as a step down and more of a pivot to a role closer to the business. Careers are nonlinear, and I do think you’ll gain really valuable experience taking on this new position. I know I personally did. (Just my two cents, the title is definitely nice, but in the long arc of your career, will probably not matter)

Interestingly, this role could set you up for roles outside of DS, e.g. senior finance leadership, GM, head of \_insert\_functional\_area\_here. Ultimately, it depends on what you want next from your career. Something to consider reflecting on is “what job do I want two jobs from now?” If this role sets you up for whatever the answer to that question is, then it could be worth considering! 

**Technical Depth vs. Seniority** 

Broadly yes; as you move towards these more senior positions, technical depth does not matter as much as DS/ML conceptual understanding, relationship management, strategic thinking, leadership, etc etc

**Compensation Outlook** 

My honest take here… title for title, DS/ML leadership roles pay way more.

Leadership is a good way to see how data flows in your org and design the practical and theoretical pipeline though it is tough to go back to technical thats not necessessarily a bad thing. I dont think there is anything wrong with switching from technical to leadership, just make sure to make time for technical practice and be in charge of your own education.

Its somewhat difficult to be a uniquely contributing IC because systems are designed to turn technical talent into replaceable input out put parts but leadership is something that you can develop in different ways and make an individual mark.

I worked on a niche team that was a joint venture in the non-profit space doing anything ds based for about 10-15 clients. This included data scraping, data engineering, pipeline creating in Azure/GCP, simulation models, ML models, regression, tableau dashboards, and many other things I am probably forgetting. In short I was a pure generalist in the space, with limited resources since our team wasn't revenue generating.

Since October my former manager and I started our own business but that covers about 10-15 hours a week and we haven't made enough on it for me to focus solely on it and to not need a 9-5. 

I have handed out well over 1000 resumes now and can't get a stream of interviews going. I get maybe a call back every month or so, made it far in a bunch of these interviews but haven't had any luck and almost all of these jobs give 0 feedback or the feedback they give is outside my control in the current moment. Ex. I had a member of my former company tell me I wasn't technical enough for a role writing white papers for their team, they hired a PhD. I can go for a PhD, but I can't do that overnight. 

I need some advice on how to navigate this market, and if there are skills I can acquire in the meantime to help push me over the edge. At this point nothing is off the table but I would be lying if I said this experience hasn't negatively affected my mental health and confidence in my skills. 

Here are my skills/credentials and some things I think will help but want to hear other opinions. At this point anything would be helpful so feel free to suggest anything. 

BA and MA in economics, 4 years experience as a DS, 1 undergrad thesis and 1 capstone project. 

Python (built and automated web scrapers, data cleaning tasks, modeling, use it daily for pretty much everything)

R (lots of modeling, data cleaning tasks, used it daily through school and monthly since working)

SQL (would build the odd prompt and use it in python to pull data into a pipeline. Overall I can use it, but I am much better at using it to pull data and doing things in pipelines with Py and R)

Azure/GCP (worked within pipelines to automate processes in ML factory, used both as warehousing tools as a start or endpoint for pipelines)

I have been asked about Docker and Kubernetes in some interviews, are these worth spending time on? With the business I am still setting up the back end and have 4 clients so I can gain skills practically in that sense and incorporate them into my own company. Is it worth it to go do a Master's in DS and/or a PhD? If there is any other suggestions I am happy to hear you out.

mmzeinx,1jtcjlc,Ok-Opening7160,"Should I do my masters in statistics right after my undergrad? For context, I'm in my senior year studying mathematics at a top Canadian Uni (Domestic student), I'm graduating in 2026. My undergrad is in mathematical optimization, where I've taken a breath of courses in statistics, optimization, computer science and business, but I haven't been able to dig deep into any one of those subjects. I've currently done 1.5 years of internships in various data-adjacent roles, and will graduate with 2 years of internship experience (including an F100 company).

My main reason for doing a masters is to gain more knowledge in areas that I want to pursue (Statistics, Operations Research), and potentially work in Europe. While I learned a lot in my undergrad and did well (3.8/4 GPA), I want to specialize in my areas of interest as my undergrad courses were fairly broad.

Currently I'm targeting Statistics/Applied Math programs at Imperial, UCL, LSE, Oxbridge and TUM, but I'm not sure if its a good idea to pursue my masters right after graduating. In terms of finances, TUM would be more affordable, but there is a language barrier (I've started practicing German) and the program is 2 years. The UK schools are more internationally renowned in statistics and are 1 year programs, but are more expensive (~ 30k-45k GBP). I will have around ~30k CAD in savings by the time I graduate, but I would have to rely on scholarships/loans/parent's help for the rest.

mljodjp,1js1sgj,Fatal-Raven,"I work in manufacturing where data is hard to get and sample sizes are arbitrarily small. 

I recently needed to get descriptive stats of historical data (n=400) and compare a small batch run (n=72) for process validation to the historical. 

I’ve had to build my historical data over the past several months, and even n=400 is small relative to the volume of production. It follows a beta distribution. Small batch runs for this product characteristic, however, are often left skewed. 

The company I’m currently with will calculate an average, min, and max for every attribute and make big process and product design decisions from it. They don’t understand what a distribution is. 

Anyway, when I have enough data, I go with transformations or nonparametric methods…I’ll report descriptive stats appropriate to whatever method I use and state it in my reports and presentations. In this case, I couldn’t use either option. I went with modeling using MCMC. I modeled both the historical and small batch run, then ran a comparison (suspected my small batch run was statistically different). 

Most people in my industry have never seen Bayesian methods, so they don’t trust it. Educating stakeholders isn’t an option. I translate the Bayesian terms into frequentist terms for their benefit. For example, I don’t say “credible interval,” I just say “interval” and let everyone understand it as a confidence interval. 

I also don’t bother reporting on my MCMC model diagnostics. R-hat, energy change, and convergence means nothing to the stakeholders. But they understand a p-value = 1.000 is meaningful, so I reported that along with the descriptive stats of the small batch run after MCMC. 

Not sure if MCMC is a viable option for you, but it’s something in my statistics toolbox I use often for small and medium sized datasets. Even if the stakeholders don’t understand what I’m doing, I present it in terms they understand and it makes me feel more confident when they make decisions based on the information.

I apologize if this information isn't new to you, but I don't see anyone else here commenting on this so I want to point it out.

Are the observations in your dataset independent?  If not, linear regression isn't appropriate.  If your data is a time series you will probably want to use a time series.  If your data has groups of observations that might not be independent, you might want to use a linear mixed model.
Does your response variable follow a normal distribution?  If not, linear regression isn't appropriate.  Generalized linear models work well for these.
Does all of your observations have equal ""weight""?  If not, there are techniques to address this.

Once you've answered these questions there are other considerations.
Many ML models require that all of the predictors are on roughly the same scale (tree based models are the only exceptions that I'm aware of to this rule).
Categorical variables need to be transformed into dummy variables and these should not be scaled.
If you're doing classification on a highly imbalanced data set you can use different sampling techniques to improve recall.


Linear regression really doesn't need ""big data"" to perform decently.  Sure, having more data will increase the confidence in your predictions.  But it probably won't change the predictions all that much.  You said in another comment that the predictions from your regression model didn't make much sense.

You’re not going to use your DS tools almost at all, it’s a separate skill. Think of the endpoints basically as a way to route requests and send parameters to functions on the fly, that’s it. Anything more complex should probably be handled with a function call to external scripts. You can learn the concepts of HTTP requests in an afternoon just from wiki. If you’re interacting with a database, make sure you know SQL well including DDL statements.

Here was the biggest jump from DS/DA for me: It’s worth getting in good Python programming habits, like good module organization, pulling out constants and support utils into separate scripts, managing versioned custom and open source requirements with requirements.txt and github, only importing required objects and thinking carefully about namespaces, init files, etc, setting up reusable libraries for custom exceptions, common handlers, shared logic, transaction handling, etc., and (critical!) doing local development inside containers.

\- set up a UI client. This is ULTRA easy, just do it, connect it to some nodejs server and you'll learn so much by just looking at what you did. if you use some cursor or some other LLM it should take you less than a day.  
\- POSTMAN - its a nice tool to explore APIs of different websites, you can watch some tutorials of how to use it and study APIs through the usage.

All I mentioned above is very very simple, I know how scary it is to start acquiring some new field but if you relax into it and just do it step by step, then by the end of a 3day learning you'll be far ahead of where you are now!",0,1743850736.0

If it’s a loop, I would prepare for leet code questions. Amazon does not have a separate MLE job family, so MLEs must meet the Amazon SDE technical bar, which involves passing the following coding competencies (each is assessed separately with its own dedicated question, but two may be assessed in a single interview over two questions):
- coding (data structures and algorithms)
- coding (problem solving)
- coding (logical and maintainable)

In addition, they will likely have an ML functional section that may be more ML system design, or may be more general ML questions. 

But, it can get a bit blurry, as because there isn’t a dedicated MLE job family, there are some rare situations where the job family might not be SDE for MLE roles, and instead be in the applied scientist family or solutions architect family.

mloal7b,1jrdrpx,akornato,"You're right to question the relevance of PCA or K-means when the job description screams LLMs and fine-tuning.  In my experience, Amazon, like many companies, sometimes defaults to standard interview loops even when the specific role requires a different focus.  It's a safe bet to prioritize GenAI concepts – transformers, attention mechanisms, prompt engineering, fine-tuning techniques, etc. – but having a basic understanding of core ML concepts won't hurt.  The reality is you might get both, and being overprepared is better than underprepared.  Focus on what the job description emphasizes, and if you get curveball questions, explain your reasoning based on the role's requirements.

Ideally, your interviewer will tailor the questions to the GenAI focus, but it's smart to be ready for anything.  Demonstrating a clear understanding of how GenAI fits into the broader ML landscape will make you stand out.  If you encounter questions that seem off-topic, connect your answers back to the job description.  For example, if asked about K-means, you could discuss its limitations compared to modern clustering techniques used in NLP or how traditional ML evaluation metrics might not be suitable for generative models.

Identify the current market rate. Then assess if you want to go above or below that 

1) above if you can deliver above what is typical for the market, and you were willing to run a boutique operation with fewer clients. You’re confident you can attract high paying clients and you can deliver at a level that other people cannot. You can also make a strong sales pitch for why your work should be valued above market rate. For example, maybe you’re really great at helping clients make business decision decisions, and consulting with them on what to do with insights. 

2) below market rate if you were trying to undercut others, don’t want to deal with #1 above.

Basically identify your value proposition — why should someone hire you? Position that relative to where potential customers are at, think about their mindset, the decisions they’re making, why they are hiring and what their spending is. Finally identify your strategy… Do you want lots of work quickly, or are you willing to risk little or no work. Then use that to decide how to position yourself relative to market rate

Your CV should be a resume; even if you pass the keyword search filtration no recruiter or hiring manager is going to read three pages. 

As far as resume goes, these are some things to think about:

 - Get everything on one page, looks like your most relevant work experience is between 2017-2021 @ multinational telco and international marketing agency. 

- Impact first, then methodology. If you want to pass some keyword search algorithms a “key skills” section is a great way to shove your buzzwords in there. In that same vein, your bolding is wrong and you should highlight the metrics (efficiency gains, accuracy, churn model). 

- Translate metric increases to business impact. The simple fact is that most business impact you see on a resume is a back of the envelope calculation. You can and should do the same.

- Use your experience section to highlight those key business impact achievements, right now you’re stating those things twice and thats just a waste of space.

- Structure: this is important, probably the most of any advice people can give you. For you specifically,  key sections are a brief intro statement, experience (highlight 2017-2021 work most), education (this should exclusively be formal education not coursera - hiring managers actively disregard this now), and maybe projects if you have space. Projects would be a great spot to highlight the full stack web dev experience you’ve accumulated while self employed.

Tbh remove personal interests and your certs & courses other than cloud stacks (no one cares in my opinion since they've become so diluted and are largely meaningless nowadays). Get it down to two pages. If you had a really funky career path you could do three, but stick to two in your case.

I'll suggest drafting a holistic narrative to help direct you. You need to focus on two aspects of your life - before and after trying to start your own business.

The **first aspect** is being a wagey in the Telco industry.

If all those Telco companies are the same company but different position then combine them, and if not maybe you can generalize your experience in the Telco industry and talk about the highlights since it looks like 15 years of your life was spent there. If they are different companies, your churn rate at each one will certainly funnel you more into contractor type roles since people are hesitant to hire someone for 1-2 years. How did your career grow? What led you into starting your own business?

The **second aspect** is starting your own business.

If you can, I'd open source the apps you built on github. Maybe just the ones you know aren't going anywhere in the future. What did you learn about business? How will you apply what you've learned to help the company you applied for?

  
With 15 years of experience you should be a shoe-in for a role even in this job market. It might not pay what you want, but you'll get a job. You really just need to clean up your resume and draft the narrative you're trying to sell for what you want.

It is possible if you build a causal diagram and use actual causal inference techniques, but IMO they are not practical in most settings.

Something no-one seems to have mentioned yet is that your industry matters — i.e., in pharmaceuticals, biomedicine, or finance a PhD / master's degree might be much more relevant than in a tech startup. ""PhD preferred"" in job applications is often just because PhD often just signals strong analytical skills, it's not a strict requirement. If you’re committed to an industry where longer-term research is a big priority then a PhD / master's degree is going to be more valuable.

**But...**

Doing such a degree means losing years of experience and building connections with people. In terms of opportunity cost, honestly, if your goal is to increase salary, it is much cheaper / easier to do that by being strategic about your work contributions, roles, and so on than doing a research degree.

The biggest limitations tend to come from working as an individual contributor vs. in management / leadership or as an entrepreneur. But honestly you have to figure out what you want and what tradeoffs you're ok with.

Short answer, it's tough but not impossible. 

Long answer, it depends on a variety of factors. Medicine/healthcare/life sciences are a v niche in terms of domain and data knowledge and these are important requirements (30-60%) to do your job as a data scientist.

1. Tenure - Are you early in your career, mid management or much more senior in leadership positions? In my experience, it's easy to switch domains in your early career (<4-5 years, still v much hands on and technical), people are willing to train you. At the same time, it's easier to switch at a senior position as well because you are expected to bring thought leadership and guide large teams. In middle management, it's tough since you're expected to know the data and domain really well along with your technical skills. 

2. Type of role - Roles that involve working with clinical R&D teams (think biostatisticians) have a v specific requirement and will need you to have experience in the same space. Marketing/commercial analytics as well requires heavy business and data knowledge. However if the company has a team (typically within IT) that works on productionalised solutions (think MLOps, BI dashboards), they often hire technically qualified people and don't expect them to bring data and domain expertise.

3. Type of company - This is a big one. Consultancies are open to hiring people without domain specific experience but life science companies may be less willing to do so. It also depends on the data maturity and need of the company. If they are scaling and hiring lots of folks, or have a proper training system in place (rare), they'd hire people with just technical skills.

I still think, if you want to you could find a role that fits. You can look up job openings across different companies on linkedin and research what their requirements are. That's the best way to get a clear picture about this.",5,1743674816.0

Chill out . This is booming like any other tech, give it 1 or 2 years and everyone will avoid AI stuff . Let me tell you something:

\- first we had the IoT / cloud whatever . Every company in the world suddenly created app for every stupid fucking thing and everything was smart ( fridge -> smart fridge, printer -> smart printer, faucet -> smart faucet ) and so on . What happened afterwards ? More and more people started to look for alternatives that were not depedent on this kind of services ( me for example I decided to go for a brother printer just because the rest of the companies tries to sell me some kind of stupid pwa app that does nothing . I want a printer, I want to plug it, power it and I expect for it to work ) . 

\- then we had crypto / nft shit . Everyone suddenly became finance & stock experts. Every little product started to sell you some blockchain shit or some metaverse crap . In the end everyone forgot about this. 

\- now you have this AI crap which is a parroting app. Suddenly everyone became a ceo and started to build wrappers over wrappers to sell their shitty product and buy you in some stupid subscription that it's useless .

The recession is coming, everyone is desperate, every dipshit thinks that he can become programmer by using cursor / gpt or some other shit stuff but let me tell you something: This dipshits will hit a brickwall, will encounter lawsuits because they're too stupid to learn cybersecurity. In the end professionals will be hired and these dipshits will be avoided.

In the end originality will win and a creative designer / developer will launch products that matter and will earn money and will be hired . The rest of crud apps senior spaghetti engineers will need to either learn this stuff or enjoy working at McDonalds. 

This is coming from a fellow developer which makes fun of my leads when they tried hiring cheap devs, spent shit ton of money on AI products and still can't get close of doing half of my job .

I may at times use it to give me ideas on how to go about projects, but if I asked it to specifically code my whole project, it wouldn’t get everything correct.

The plagiarism to me feels like power control and unnecessary. But businesses provide what customers want the most and most people seem to be enjoying using AI for trivial things. I proposed a few good project ideas to my bosses and they turned down everything, and they don't even know AI, they are just developers who became managers and not once worked on any AI project or cared to learn about AI at all, but since they are managers, they get to set the rules, so I stopped putting in the effort. And it's true, it may not happen overnight, but gradually, AI is replacing many, many jobs! What we think of as a poor or okay job or average results by AI services will soon be made almost perfect, just like that, and I am honestly worried for the poor or those with a lot of dependants and debt! And I am learning that no matter what advancement in technology comes in and goes out, in the corporate industry, you will have to accept stupid leaders making wrong decisions and their politics and biases and what not! In our company, there were a few rounds of layoffd because of several bad decisions made by the management and for half of them, the reason given was that AI had replaced their jobs/their jobs were automated, yet those at the top and their favourites are the only people who get to feel highlys ecure about keeping their jobs.

ml1xsla,1jnh32k,some_models_r_useful,"This post gives me an opportunity to talk about something that I haven't heard discussed much by anyone, maybe because its just a goofy thing I think about.

There is an interesting relationship between probability and expectation that show up when discussing MSE and MAE. When I studied this I wanted a better answer than ""this model minimizes the MSE"" or ""this model has a low MSE"" when describing error--what I want to know, intuitively, what that actually guaranteed me when thinking about predictions.

Like, if you say ""this model has a low MSE"", and I say, ""Oh okay, does that mean that predictions are generally close to the true value? If I get a new value, is the probability that its far away small?"" You can't (immediately) say ""The average error is low and therefore the error is low with high probability""; you have to actually do a little work, where I think concentration inequalities become useful.

Specifically, in a simplistic case, if I have predictions f(X) for a quantity Y, MSE estimates E\[(f(X)-Y)\^2). If we pretend for a moment that f(X) is an unbiased estimator for E\[Y|X\], then the MSE essentially estimates Var(f(X))+Var(Y | X). By the triangle inequality, recall that |f(X)-Y| <= |f(X)-E\[Y\]|+|Y-E\[Y\]|. As a result, P(|f(X)-Y| > a ) <= P(|f(X)-E\[Y|X\]|+|Y-E\[Y|X\]| > a) <= P(|f(X)-E\[Y|X\]| > a)+P(|Y-E\[Y|X\]| > a).  Since Var(f(X)) and Var(Y|X) are both bounded by their sum, call it (sigma1\^2+sigma2\^2), we have that P(|f(X)-E\[Y|X\]| > k(sigma1\^2+sigma2\^2)) <= 2/k\^2. In other words, as a conservative, distribution-free bound, there is a guarantee that our predictions are close to Y in a probabilistic sense, and that involves the MSE because sigma1\^2+sigma2\^2 is what MSE estimates. Abusing notation a bit, using Chebychev's inequality, P(|f(X)-E\[Y|X\]| > kMSE) <= 2/k\^2. So if you report to me the MSE, I can tell you, for example, that at LEAST 95% of predictions will be within about 6.3 MSE's of the truth. If f(X) is biased, then the guarantee gets weirder because if f(X) has a small variance and a big bias then you can't make the guarantee arbitrarily good. (This is another reason unbiased estimators are nice).

So using concentration inequalities like Chebychev's, an unbiased model can actually say with some degree of confidence how many observations are close to the true value, with very few assumptions.

On the other hand, MAE estimates |f(X)-E\[Y|X\]| directly. So if I have a good MAE estimate, can I make any similar claims about what proportion of f(X) are close to Y? Well, in this case the probability is baked into the error itself! The thing MAE converges to literally says ""Half of the time, our error will be bigger than this number."" It is not a tight bound. It does not require anything like unbiasedness. That's what you get. Hypothetically, if you have the data, you can estimate directly what proportion of your errors will be bigger than a number, though; like 95th Percentile Absolute Error. But MAE doesn't automatically give that to you.

To summarize: MSE gives you a number that, using concentration inequalities, and a somewhat strong assumption that your model is unbiased, gives you bounds on how close your predictions are to the truth. A small MSE with an unbiased estimator precisely means that most of your observations are close to the truth. MAE on the other hand gives you a number that doesn't necessarily mean that most of your observations are close to the truth. It specifically means that half of the predictions should be less than the MAE away from the truth.

In that sense, a low MSE is a ""stronger"" guarantee of accuracy than a low MAE. But it comes at a cost because 1) obtaining sharper bounds than Chebychev's is probably really hard, so the bound is really really conservative, and 2) MSE is highly influenced by outliers compared to MAE, meaning that you potentially need a lot of data for a good MSE estimate. MAE is a bit more ""direct"" at answering how close observations are to the truth and much easier to interpret probabilistically. It is probably a better measure of ""center"" if you want a general sense of where your errors are and don't care about the influence of, say, single really bad errors, compared to just being able to see how well the best half of your predictions do.",1,1743613841.0

As others have said, sometimes we need to make practical compromises, but we should always start by identifying the strategically relevant quantity and establishing a chain of reasoning that connects our estimates/predictions to that quantity.

I'm someone who's in the process of transitioning to more data related roles in the pursuit of getting to a data science career trajectory and I wanted some input on if you think this is a good way to go about it. For some background, I have an Economics w/ Specialization in Data Science from a top US university, with a minor in CS. My data science courses were a particular strong point for me in college. 



I have been working for a large company as a Support Engineer where I did very well, but was recently offered a role as a Business Operations Manager, which I am currently onboarding in.

  
Due to my academic DS skills, my role will be structured such that I will be partly analyzing data and generating insights through decks to help the leadership team in support to know what changes they should be making to improve KPIs, but I will also be helping the analytics team to generate predictive models to aid in improving manager reactivity to customer escalations. I'm curious as to whether you guys think this role will be a good start to start getting really good work experience to get a much more meaty DS role in a couple of years. Is there anything more I should be thinking about in this role to get a clearer career path into DS?

Simultaneously, I am applying to several Masters programs and planning to join one by the end of this year or beginning of the next, targeting programs like GATech OMSCS, Berkeley MIDS, and UPENN MSE-DS. Those are my top 3, but I have a few more on the list as well. I think these masters would be beneficial in me gaining additional skills while building up more work experience in the data realm as well, but would like a sanity check here. I'm also curious as to what you guys think about going for a pure DS Masters vs a CS masters with a specialization in Data Science. I know a lot of people recommend the CS masters for additional flexibility, but since I already have a background in both areas, I'm unsure which way to go.

mkpnip2,1jnupvt,Jeremy_Simhon,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some help deciding between two graduate programs. I’ve been accepted into both and have about a week left to make my final decision — the Cornell enrollment deposit is due April 7th, so I’m trying to make the most informed choice possible before then.

Here are the two programs I’m considering:

* Cornell University – MS in Business Analytics (MSBA)[ https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/specialized-masters/ms-in-business-analytics/](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/specialized-masters/ms-in-business-analytics/)
* Northwestern University – MS in Data Science (SPS)[ https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.html](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.html)

# Background:

I’m aiming for a data-driven career, likely as a business data analyst, data scientist, or something at the intersection of data and strategy. I want a program that offers a solid technical foundation, strong career support, and long-term value when it comes to reputation and employer perception.

Financially, I was lucky to receive a merit-based scholarship from Cornell, which brings its cost very close to Northwestern’s, so money is not the main deciding factor here.

# My Dilemma:

* I’ve heard some mixed reviews about Northwestern’s School of Professional Studies (SPS) — mainly that it’s not as highly regarded as other Northwestern graduate programs, and that the online part-time MSDS program isn’t seen as prestigious as their full-time, in-person option.  
* On the other hand, Cornell’s MSBA is part of the Johnson Graduate School of Management, with a 16-month, part-time structure that includes in-person summer residencies and a cohort-based model. It seems more structured, more immersive, and has strong business connections.  

Despite Cornell being Ivy League and Northwestern not, I personally don’t fully buy into the idea that “Ivy = better” by default. In my eyes, Cornell and Northwestern are pretty neck and neck when it comes to overall brand recognition and academic reputation — especially in the data/tech space. I just want to make sure I’m choosing the program that will help me stand out to employers and truly fits my goals.

# What I’m Hoping to Learn:

If you’re familiar with either program — or work in the industry and know how these are viewed — I’d really appreciate your thoughts on:

* Which program is more impressive or respected by employers in data/analytics roles?  
* Does the SPS label at Northwestern actually hurt job prospects compared to a program like Cornell’s?  
* Which program would you choose if your goals were like mine?  

I know both are excellent schools with strong reputations, and I feel really fortunate to be in this position — I just want to make the right decision and would love some outside perspective to help me get there.

I have 10 yoe as a software dev in web but I really like/miss doing more mathy experimental stuff that leans on scientific method and relies on forming hypotheses and story telling.

Univ. San Diego masters in applied data science - i really like this program because of the small class size, hands on emphasis, low price tag, and overall demeanor of the staff. Im concerned that this field relies heavily on pedigree to get anywhere meaningful and this school might not be highly regarded. Does that really matter?

UC Berkeley MSDS - obvi a household name with a great program and as far as I can tell from others accounts, a fast track ticket out of the recruiter black hole. Im concerned about the rigor and competitiveness of the program and student body and the price tag.

Primarily I'm interested in the material and opportunityto network and meet other smart people and build cool stuff. I would pay more and put up with more competition or high strung classmates if pedigree really makes the difference but if any masters will do ill definitely take the more hands on low key and cheaper program.

1. Would it be worth it to take a lower paying job if I know I will get a lot more practical experience? For example, I have an opportunity to work as a research scientist for a lab at my university that would pay me around $70k with the same benefits as a faculty member, which are really good (401k, pension, great health insurance, etc).

It also seems like some of the skills I'd be learning will be less applicable to other data science jobs.

  
2. How important is it to have the minimum/preferred qualifications listed in a job posting? Are companies as will to hire physics PhDs as they were several years ago when the field started blowing up? 

  
3. How much bargaining power do I have when it comes to salary if I know I don't technically meet all requirements? Should I expect to be rejected if I ask for a salary that is too high (I'm thinking like $150k+ vs \~$100k)

mkiuaoq,1jn9p9e,traderprof,"Since you mentioned an interest in both statistics/causal inference and potentially DL, I'd suggest considering Julia as a complementary language to Python.

I've been working with both Python and Julia in my data science work, and Julia has several advantages for statistical and mathematical computing:

1. It's incredibly fast (close to C speeds) while maintaining Python-like readability
2. It has excellent packages for Bayesian inference (Turing.jl) and causal inference (CausalInference.jl)
3. Particularly for statistical work, the syntax is often cleaner than Python

What I've found most valuable isn't just the technical capabilities, but how Julia encourages clearer thinking about statistical problems. The code often more directly represents the mathematical formulation, which makes documentation and knowledge sharing more effective.

That said, Python's ecosystem is unbeatable for production ML workflows and integration with other systems. So rather than fully switching, I use both: Julia for statistical exploration and specific modeling tasks, Python for the broader workflow and deployment.

The most valuable aspect has been that learning Julia deepened my understanding of computational statistics concepts in a way that made me better at Python too. The time investment paid off not just in adding a tool but in strengthening my overall approach to data problems.",12,1743345160.0
mkjht8r,1jn9p9e,7182818284590452,"If you want to do stats, the breadth and depth in R is way better than python. 

Breadth:
You will be very hard pressed to find something not in R. There is a long history of academics writing packages

For example, the original inventor of random forest made an R package when he published. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html when he published. 

Depth:
Hypothesis tests always have minor statistical details. 

T test assuming pooled standard deviation or not. R's t test has both. Just need to change an argument. 

Continuity corrections on or off? Just change an argument to a function call. 

The function for computing confidence intervals for a proportion has like 10 different methods due to different publications all equally valid, statistically. The default method is the one most use. 

A MLE estimate or a method of moments estimate for variance in glm models? R has them both.

In generalized linear models, CIs for slops are based on Wald approach. You can find functions for score intervals and likelihood intervals too. 


Speed:
For speed, vectorized R is single threaded and about as fast single threaded looping in C++.  Beyond that, R can be used as a glue language to call C++, python, etc. Many packages do this and the user does not even know it. 

Some R packages use the same C++ packages sci kit learn uses. SVM models are an example of this. 

In python, numpy is usually installed so that it is multi threaded and with a high performance BLAS. R does not do this. Multi threaded linear algebra will always be faster than single threaded linear algebra. 

I imagine single thread numpy is similar to vectorized R code.",8,1743352665.0

Math, especially in data science, isn’t about being naturally gifted; it’s about building fluency over time. You don’t need to be a genius to understand linear algebra or stats, but you *do* need to be consistent. Instead of trying to learn everything at once, focus on understanding the “why” behind each concept. Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown, and StatQuest are all amazing resources that break things down visually and intuitively. Sometimes all it takes is hearing it explained a different way for it to click.

Also, don’t be afraid to slow down and actually write stuff out. It sounds old-school, but working through equations by hand can help internalize the logic. Pair that with practical coding—use Python or R to apply what you’re learning in small projects or Kaggle problems. When you connect theory with real-world problems, it sticks way better.

I don't know where your gaps are, but you need to start with Algebra and ensure you remember the basics.  Move up from there.  It's a LOT faster to re-learn when you do this, but I think a lot of people forget the basics and the theory behind the basics and go the lazy route.

I have a math background, but forgot the majority of math I learned.  However, when I decide that I want to re-learn, I go online or use chatgpt to re-learn.  But you'll need to take pauses, do some code or problem solving, and move on.

mkciddg,1jma2jy,_stoof,"One approach that I think may be helpful is to approach this from regression. Start with linear regression. Can you derive the estimator for the coefficients? What about the variance of it? You mentioned that you want to improve your programming as well so implement this as you go. In R, it is implemented using a QR decomposition. You can also implemented linear regression using SVD. Try to derive beta hat in terms of the SVD and QR decompositions. Maybe you need to look up those decompositions; this is where the exercise is useful. You might find this easy or difficult but you will immediately find which areas you get stuck on and need to reference. You can take this as quick or deep as you want. Which assumptions are most important? What do correlated X change about the estimate? 

Generalized linear models would be a natural next step. You learn about the exponential family (exercise: find the expected value and variance and you will learn about the score function/Fisher information). You don't have a nice closed form so you will need to learn about weighted least squares. How does R or python implement this?

While there's no magic shortcut to mastering math, there are definitely resources tailored for data science that can help you grasp the concepts without diving deep into full-on calculus or linear algebra.

For a solid starting point, check out ""Practical Statistics for Data Scientists"" by Peter Bruce and Andrew Bruce. It’s pretty approachable and focuses on the statistical methods that are super relevant to data work. Similarly, ""The Art of Data Science"" by Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui gives a nice overview of the data science process, integrating some necessary statistical thinking.

If you're looking for something a bit more interactive, websites like Khan Academy or Coursera have sections specifically for statistics in the context of data science. These can help you build intuition without getting too bogged down by the math itself.

Also, don't hesitate to lean on online communities for help when you're stuck! Just remember, everyone feels like they're struggling at some point—it’s all part of the learning curve. Good luck!",1,1743310355.0

Curious and motivated falls under the long-term potential category and are what will put you over the edge between two equally matched candidates.

mkiubrk,1jm4yzm,traderprof,"As someone who's been on both sides of this equation (hiring and being hired), I've noticed an interesting pattern around curiosity and motivation that might explain your experience.

Many companies genuinely do value curiosity, but they struggle to evaluate it effectively in their hiring processes. In my experience:

1. **Curiosity manifests differently than hiring processes measure**: Most hiring processes are optimized for skills evaluation (coding challenges, technical questions), not for assessing curiosity. Real curiosity often comes through in how someone documents their thinking process and contextualizes their work.

2. **The delta matters more than absolutes**: I've found that the most successful hires aren't necessarily those who know the most upfront, but those who rapidly absorb context about the business domain and connect technical solutions to real problems. This kind of contextual curiosity is hard to assess in interviews.

3. **Documentation reveals curiosity**: One practical way I've evaluated curiosity is by looking at how candidates document their work. Curious people tend to not just solve problems but explain their reasoning, explore alternatives, and connect their solutions to wider contexts.

When I'm hiring, I explicitly look for evidence that candidates go beyond the immediate technical problem to understand the ""why"" behind it. This often comes through in how they communicate and document their thought process rather than in direct claims about being curious.

Have you tried highlighting specific examples of how your curiosity led to better outcomes in previous work? Concrete examples tend to be more convincing than general statements about your approach.",2,1743345170.0

And be prepared for follow-ups. Anybody can say they are curious, motivated, a self-starter, good with people, etc., but a savvy interviewer will want specific examples.

1. Check your capitalization, you have words mid sentence that shouldn't be capitalized and some whole things (client value creation, and leadership) which should have caps are missing it. This shows poor attention to detail, which would immediately make me pass on this - especially in today's market.  
2. Someone mentioned before that this is dry. I agree. Your resume reads more like you just pasted your job description. It needs more of the ""so what?"" factor.  
3. Continuing from previous points, you kind of just list tasks/projects and your have skills section have random buzzwords. Part of me is suspicious that you change that section, and only that section depending on the job you are applying for, or you don't tailor your resume to the job you are applying for based on the skill section alone.  
4. You aren't entry level anymore, your experience should come first, skills should be after experience and education.  
5. With 6 years of experience, you barely have 1 field of domain expertise. As a hiring manager, I'd call BS on that immediately. Ex. looks like you were on 1 pharma project w/ Accenture, but you have healthcare as a domain expertise.  First of all, pharma and healthcare aren't the same industry. More importantly, a single project doesn't give you domain expertise. Nix that section, it does more harm than good here.

1. Generally the “experience” section should come before the “skills” section
2. Someone other commenters mentioned this already, but the points in your **experience section** are hard to read. I would reduce it to 2 lines max.
3. Again, in your **experience section**, I think your resume would be more engaging if you boldened key achievements within each bullet point.
4. I see that you have used some metrics in your **experience section**, make sure that these are always in numeric form (ie. millions in USD, could be ~ $5M+) — by using the $ symbol it would most likely be taken as USD if you are applying to jobs in the US, if not then convert to local currency so recruiters can understand.
5. In the **education section** I see that you listed something along side your bachelors, if this is high school related, I suggest you remove it, and it is a more advanced degree would place it above the bachelors degree.
6. In the **achievements section** I am unsure how impressive those achievements are, if they are something that you think a recruiter would care about, then leave it, otherwise remove it. Imo, if you have advanced AWS or Azure certifications these would be relevant, and I would create a **certifications section**, which would be above the **achievements section**.
7. Since you’ve only worked as a data scientist and there’s no explicit mention of MLOps anywhere else in your resume other than the title, a recruiter may not see how your skillset is relevant to that job title, so I would remove this from your **header section**.
8. I would consider revamping **summary section** to highlight key takeaways from your resume. What’s your goal? What are your skills? What have you done so far? The length is good but I would try to make it more readable.",1,1743103709.0

Things that can help:

1. Reformat your CV, have a column on the right or left to highlight your skills clearly. Have a summary section at the top. Use of bold and larger font to highlight position title, company and dates.

2. Shorten your dot points and remove waffle. Quality over quantity. Get straight to the point. You can exaggerate achievements still within reason (it's a cv; everyone does this and has to in a competitive job market) but make it less obviously waffle. Simple, strong language.

3. Just a thought from me, may not be relevant. But if you're applying for senior data scientist positions rather than data scientist, that's probably a big reason why.

Skills go bottom, if you even actually need it.  Most of your skills should be inferred through your bullet points.  Domain expertise shouldn't even be needed, that 100% should be inferred through your job history.  Techstack, I don't even know why those are there.  Those aren't really a ""tech stack"".  Technical skills can all be inferred.  Languages no one cares.  If you're going to put something in skills it needs to be something really really niche and unexpected basically.  Anyone who has 3+ years in data science I already know they know shit like python, numpy, etc.  I don't need to read it on their CV.  If you want to put something there put something like ""C/C++ embedded systems""  something that really stands out.  That might not be obvious.

Bullet points on experience way too long.  Your first bullet point on your top job for example could easily just be ""Reduced execution time of an existing models by 95% by implementing it in Spark and MLFlow"".  The second sentence of your first bullet point is just word vomit.  You don't need to be hyper specific, and you don't need to throw so many buzzwords.  

Like ""Automated triggers provide real-time updates, with an interactive chatbot, enabling informed budget planning and proactive action sin financial KPIs to C level executives"" should just be it's own bullet point.  But you can just simply say.  ""Created automated triggers to provide real-time updates to stakeholders by implementing a chatbot to interact with the models.""  You don't need to be specific about financial KPI's, no one cares what the specific thing is you're providing.

Your second bullet point on that job like no one knows what ""Global Warranty Early Warning System"" is and no one cares.  You're using hyper specific things that is just creating this fluff.  Also, You Don't Need To Capitalize Every Letter In A System Or Model Name, It's Annoying And Hurts Your Eyes.  You could just write ""Reduced operational and unexpected costs for other departments (by x% \[without this your claim is BS\]) by implementing an early warning system to detect potential issues.

Like there's so much of this.  One bullet point should basically be one sweet and to the point sentence.  Generic sample:  What I did, how i did it (briefly 4-5 words max), what the impact was.

  
IDK what xii in science is, or if it has any relevance, but considering it was 10 years ago, I doubt anyone cares anymore.

Finally, I really hate personal statements.  If you want to do a personal statement, do it in your cover letter or introductory email.  If you are going to include, it should be short and sweet, 1 sentence maybe 15 words max.  Something along the lines of: ""What I am, what I do, what I'm looking for"".  Too many companies will read this though and pigeonhole you into only being able to do that stuff, that's why I leave it off.  And it's generally just fluff.",1,1743169347.0

mk0a4hd,1jl1ldy,redisburning,"The AI hype will eventually blow over (it might take the economy down with it) if you wanted to just go do something else for a while (like a temporary return to insurance). Having actually worked very closely with language models as transformers started taking over, I can state categorically that the management class believes in a literal fantasy version of what these things can do.

Eventually, you gotta deliver products. Ones that people want to use.

That said, I think it's worth considering if you would want to be in DS on the other side of that. My hot take is that the culture of data science is absolute dog water. Too many people bringing all of the worst parts of academia (the isolation, the zero-sum mentality, that particular brand of politics that pretends to be progressive/accepting yet in reality is the same ""old boys club"" of hiring all the people from your Alma Matter because somehow magically all the good DS come from {insert Uni you went too how convenient}). I'm not willing to put up with that AND professional manager types. I left academia for a reason. And I've left DS for largely the *same* reason.

Not to doom over it, but I think the era of inferential data scientists is largely over. I don't know what will emerge on the other side of the LLM apocolypse once people start putting chatgpt segfaults into prod or cause Netflix to spend 4 billion dollars on Boss Baby sequels because someone with ""principal"" in front of their title decided to just yolo a PR, but I think again the management class has largely figured out that DS didn't do what they wanted. It provided counter-evidence against the sort of businessy hand waving they love so much. Every counterintuitive discovery that makes a DS' year enranges a VP who really thinks you're just a monkey there to dance for them.

I know you said you didn't sign up to be an SWE OP but goodness is it an improvement. Tell me what you want. I make it or tell you it's impossible, and people actually listen to me when I do.

My advice would be:

* First and foremost, prioritize your mental health! Even after all these years, I have not found a job that paid as well as when I was doing actuarial consulting. But my mental health and perspective in life has improved drastically and that lets me focus on other things.

* Consider developing skills that will enable you to be full stack (Data Eng, Modelling, ML Eng, ML Ops, Experimentation Design). Sorry to use the full stack buzz word but the reality of the situation is, I think the SWE side of things will be safest from the things you dislike about DS.

If you are in applied side of DS and working for for-profit, it’s a losing battle to try to find deeper meaning from what we do. We are not developing new algorithms or solving a previously unsolved problem that’ll make humanity slightly better. Unless selling data science products is our business, we are in a support role and we are there to build stuff that help business sell something better/save money. Nothing more or less. If you want to feel meaningful then pick an industry/cause that makes you feel fulfilled or at least happy helping. 

Business has always been blind to what truly is causal vs not or ML vs just heuristics and tbh it’s not their job. It’s our and our DS leadership’s job to communicate, educate them but we have failed to do so and broadly failed to show the meaningful marginal roi of chasing after causality over just correlational signals backed by on business understanding. GenAI is the only thing that brought general people this close to any advanced model. Definitely they are excited about it and want to see what this can do for them in business which is pretty much why every business jumped on the DS train in the first place and we are the beneficiaries of that boom.

mjxzisg,1jks145,r_search12013,"I love this post .. I'm a math phd with 10 years in data science now.. so my business has been: avoiding neural nets like the plague, now avoiding llms like the plague.. it can be done, but I won't lie, it has never been this annoying

but my bet goes as follows:  
1. the llm stuff you can't ignore right now are all being aggressively pushed by us-american companies .. google, openai, meta, (twitter), .. each of them have been hitting energy capacity in the usa and screaming for nuclear power plants for quite a while (even amazon pre AI plain for ""cloud"") .. but nuclear is extremely slow to start even.. so renewable europe or china based llm companies will just outrun these companies very soon ( [https://www.forbes.com/sites/corneliawalther/2025/03/17/the-ai-fueled-nuclear-renaissance-are-we-loosing-our-biggest-bet/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/corneliawalther/2025/03/17/the-ai-fueled-nuclear-renaissance-are-we-loosing-our-biggest-bet/) )  
2. the llm companies that are not in the us see the methods for what they are: next word prediction with ever larger contexts of information preceding that word taken into account.. but that's it .. an extremely convoluted classifier.. and people are going all eliza effect on it  ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect) )  
they learned that eliza didn't replace therapists, they'll learn that chatbots only ever solve at most 80% of the problem, and that's not a version problem, that's a conceptual problem the us llm companies willfully ignore  
3. the core of my bet: goedel's incompleteness theorems ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s\_incompleteness\_theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) ) -- each sufficiently complicated system has a statement in it that is true but not provable in the system, also, no such system can prove its own consistency  
specifically, by copying the diagonal argument you do to prove these things, you can always maneuver any kind of such chatbot into a situation where it will confidently declare two facts to be the truth, and they contradict each other  
\-- that's a design flaw in all the us based llm models, because they wanted to bet on creativity and have now been cleaning up consistency for almost a decade

tldr: it's a marketing hype with ridiculously big military grade budgets.. there's vested interest into making us all believe this current wave of shoddy software were unavoidable .. but, it's not nearly as useful as people currently believe, and eventually investors will pull out, then that bubble collapses, and data science will be data science again.. until then, try ""analyst"" .. maybe ""business intelligence"" .. very fun, not very llm :)",23,1743040653.0

- Of course code assistance. Again, they're language models, code is very structured and predictable language, which is why they've performed so well there compared to the other places people try to use them.

I also think there's space for them to be integrated with technical report boilerplate.

1. **The AI founder tech bros** – The guys who are building AI solutions to everything you can possible think of. The cadence and intensity makes you think you need these, or you're going to be replaced. This is mostly coming from the founders trying to raise ridiculous amounts of money from VCs. Anything with AI behind it gets money these days. Where is the actual value? Who knows. I've yet to see it.

2. **The ""I'm still job market relevant"" people –** These people are also insufferable, but for a different reason. Basically they want you (ideally recruiters, or potential consulting customers) to think they're on the cutting edge.

most notebooks on kaggle are crap. they are beginners trying to show off their skills

clearly you should do missingness analysis, but that is automatic


kaggle is not representative of real ds, where there is no fixed dataset.
one reason to do eda, is to identify what additional data you should obtain


for e-commerce/advertising
one eda analysis tool i recommend is a pareto curve type analysis


eg if you are predicting shop sales, how much sales is driven by each shop?
if 50% of sales is driven by the top 10 shops out of eg 1000, then collecting more data on those shops is an efficient strategy.


this analysis might apply to shops/brands/product categories etc


similarly there's a related data collection issue. maybe a week of data is sufficient for the large shops, but the smaller shops dont have enough turnover in a week for reliable estimates

# Summary of Proposed Solutions for Text Classification

Based on the Reddit discussion, here are the main approaches suggested for classifying meeting transcripts:

## 1. TF-IDF + Simple Classifier (OP's Approach)
**Description:** Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for feature extraction, potentially with dimensionality reduction, followed by a classifier like logistic regression.
**User Sentiment:** Mixed. Some users consider it a solid baseline approach that ""works fine for most cases,"" while others suggest it might be outdated compared to newer embedding methods.
**Rating:** 6/10 - Reliable but potentially not optimal for complex text data like meeting transcripts.

## 2. Fine-tuning Llama 3 (Colleagues' Approach)
**Description:** Fine-tuning a large language model (Llama 3) for the classification task.
**User Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly negative. Most users consider this ""absolute overkill,"" ""insane,"" and unnecessarily complex and expensive.
**Rating:** 2/10 - Excessive computational cost with limited benefit for a straightforward classification problem.

## 3. Pre-trained Embeddings + Simple Classifier
**Description:** Using embeddings from pre-trained models (like ModernBERT, GTE, or OpenAI embeddings) as features, then applying a simple classifier.
**User Sentiment:** Very positive. Most commenters recommend this as the optimal approach, combining modern NLP techniques with reasonable implementation complexity.
**Rating:** 9/10 - Best balance of performance and implementation effort according to multiple experts.

## 4. BERT-style Transformer Fine-tuning
**Description:** Fine-tuning a smaller transformer model (like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT) specifically for classification.
**User Sentiment:** Positive. Several users suggest this as a middle ground between TF-IDF and full LLM fine-tuning.
**Rating:** 8/10 - Good performance for complex text with manageable computational requirements.

## 5. Direct API Use (ChatGPT/GPT-4)
**Description:** Simply using an existing commercial LLM API for classification without any training.
**User Sentiment:** Mixed. Some suggest it's cost-effective and quick to implement, while others raise concerns about reliability and costs at scale.
**Rating:** 7/10 - Simple implementation but potentially costly for high-volume applications.

## Overall Consensus
The community strongly favors using pre-trained embeddings with a simple classifier as the most practical and effective approach. There's almost universal agreement that fine-tuning Llama 3 is dramatically overengineered for this task and likely being proposed to ""ride the AI hype train"" or for resume-building rather than practical application.

mjz4ae6,1jkjs7y,DuckSaxaphone,"Other people have told you to use embeddings but I don't think they've gone much into why.

You were right with your arguement that you should use a simple method and not go fine-tuning LLMs for simple classification problems. I just don't think you'd realized how much NLP developed before LLMs.

You were essentially trying to vectorize your transcripts in a meaningful way. The problem is all the old word counting methods suck, they only work in the most trivial of cases in my experience and they're really fiddly. So the vector you'd use to train a classifier would barely capture any of the real meaning of the meeting transcript.

On the other hand, pre-trained embedding models can be run on basic laptop CPUs and do an extremely good job. You want a meaningful vector so you naturally pick a model designed to turn text into vectors that directly capture semantics.

Pre-trained language models in general can take you from text to end prediction without any work - eg modernbert instead of embedding plus classification.

mk0tk6r,1jkvbkv,Educational_Ice_9676,"I hope my answer will be relevant to your question:

My approach to planning and working according to a plan is not in the tooling but in the management.

There are A LOT of different tools that help you visualize, see, explore and what not.   
BUT, from my experience, for a good research what you need is a well planned project management doc. It can be a Notion page, a word doc or even just you writing on a paper (I suggest not haha).

let me explain with an example:

So, assume you were given a task to enhance some model by 5%:

1. First, you will map what changes (on a higher level, e.g. select better trainset) you can do to enhance performance.

2. Second, you will test each of the above directions to see which one is your best bet

3. Next you'll dive deeper into that one direction you chose. for example changing the parameter tuning flow.

4. Now, you'll design a thorough test with mlflow and what not to see which flow yields best metrics.

5. Did not yield a good enough improvement in metrics? you write it down and go back to step 2.

I can go on with that example but what I wanted to show here is that when you articulate your thought and research process, then all the rest is very easy and finds its own place.

My very best researches (and I've had a few) were all just one VEEERRRY long google doc",3,1743087913.0

mjo1gzz,1jj82n6,dfphd,"As a hiring manager - this doesn't read to me like ""internal guidelines"". This reads to me like a hunting list for a sourcer.

That is - if you're not getting the right candidates just by posting a job, you will sometimes have recruiters (specifically sourcers) try to work networks, reach out directly to candidates, etc. to try to find the right talent.

If you've ever gotten a LinkedIn message from a recruiter for a job you didn't apply to? That's a sourcer.

Now, when you work with a sourcer, you need to give them a *very* specific set of attributes to look for. If you just say ""find me smart people""... they won't. You can't take a shotgun approach if you're already struggling to find the right talent.

This looks like the outcome of a conversation between a hiring manager and a recruiter where the hiring manager is saying ""this is the type of candidate that I need you to look for"". 

And with that lens, yeah - this is a perfectly fine list. 

u/Middle_Ask_5716 

>Imagine having a PhD in cs from Cambridge and not being allowed to create buttons on a website for this company.

If you're hunting, you want to keep your recruiter focused and so giving them a short list of schools that you are likely to find in the candidate pool is just more effective. Like, for every 1 Cambridge grad in the US you are going to have 1000s of grads from those 7 schools. So I highly doubt that this hiring manager would reject a Cambridge grad - they probably just aren't interested in a sourcer bothering with coming up with this huge list of schools to filter for.

Same with the PhD piece - it's not that they don't want PhDs, but probably that they don't expect to find a substantial number of PhDs that would be a good fit for this role. 

The one thing I will add - I would hope whoever is hiring for this role is paying top dollar for this role. Because this is going to be at least a $300K a year profile. Which again - it's very possible. It's very possible this is a top tier tech company, or an extremely well funded startup that is looking for an absolute rock star.",9,1742916129.0

mjgep9t,1jii855,raffadizzle,"Hey everyone! So, I'm writing from the perspective of the ""concerned partner."" My partner isn't sure now of his next steps after attaining his masters degree in data science.


Some info about us:

We live together in Mannheim, Germany, and my Portuguese partner (age 46) recently graduated with his masters degree in data science from a university in Portugal. He graduated second in his class (19/20 degree average) despite not being able to go to his courses because he was working full-time as a maths teacher. He studied and taught himself in his free time and still did extremely well, so I think that gives a bit of an indication as to his ability with maths and statistics. His thesis was even selected by his university to be published internationally because he did such a good job. He has 20+ years as a maths teacher of all levels; speaks Portuguese, Spanish, and english fluently; is extremely sociable and outgoing; and makes for a great colleague. He has found a job here in germany as a maths teacher as he figures out how to transition his career. He's definitely older than many fresh faces that recently come out of university, but I think his life experience would be an asset it many ways. 

Now the problem is, is that in his words, his degree focused a lot on the mathematics side of data science, but left out things like machine learning, and some of the most used programming languages (I remember him working a lot in R, but I think he said that they didn't even touch python). He was one of the few students in the program given an internship at a health insurance company based in Portugal, but there was absolutely no mentorship or opportunity to develop any kind of real skills. He and his two other student colleagues were basically placed in a room and they spent their days copy and pasting numbers into programs with little supervision or guidance. He was offered a chance to join the company full time after graduating, but the work was so soul-sucking that he decided against it. It definitely shook him up, because he's worried that he just put in all this effort for a degree for a job field that he might actually hate. I've tried to assure him that based on the threads I've read on here, that the field of ""Data Science"" is very broad, and that I think he just got really unlucky with this first internship. He's here in Germany now with me with a maths and physics teaching job, but he's unsure of what to do next.


If anyone has any bit of advice or if you have followup questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Probably his most desired career goal is to find a job that lets him work mostly from home and travel with me, so not necessarily climbing the career ladder all the way to the top, or making the largest salary (even though both of those things would be wonderful if they happened.)


If you've read this far, thank you!

-EDIT- So my partner wanted to add that his masters thesis was in fact about machine learning, titled “Pricing in Health insurance: Comparison between GLM and Machine Learning Models. Random Forest, GBM, and XG Boost.”

mkiu9rp,1jii855,traderprof,"As someone with experience in both data science and documentation, I'd like to share a perspective that's often overlooked: the critical importance of knowledge management and documentation in data science careers.

Many data scientists focus heavily on technical skills (Python, ML algorithms, statistics) but underestimate how much their career advancement depends on effectively documenting their work and sharing knowledge with stakeholders.

In the age of AI, this is becoming even more important. I've seen numerous data science projects fail not because of technical limitations, but because:

1. The context behind model decisions wasn't properly documented
2. Knowledge transfer between data science teams was inefficient
3. Business stakeholders couldn't understand the insights without proper contextual documentation

If you're transitioning into data science, develop a system early on for documenting your work that captures not just code but context - why certain decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and what business problems you're solving.

With generative AI now being used to create and understand documentation, the ability to provide rich context is becoming a differentiating skill for senior data scientists. In my experience, those who excel at contextual documentation often advance more quickly because they bridge the technical-business gap more effectively.

Anyone else find that documentation skills have helped their data science career?",2,1743345152.0
mjg81xd,1jii855,TheFach,"Esteemed colleagues, 

I need your advice:

I have now around 4 years of experience and I'm unsure I'm in the right place.

 3 months ago, I joined a small IT consultancy company as AI engineer after 4 years of working as a data scientist in a big manufacturing company, my concerns are not about the role (I am actually having fun developing AI and RAG-based applications) but about the team, or better, the lack of it.

In the bulk of my work experience, I have always been in a ""one man band"" kind of professional, in the 4 years as a data scientist, I had a technical senior for reference (who was not actually checking my code and work too much) and a non-technical manager with whom we were defining projects architectures and scopes, here I was doing the classical, now extinct, DS job of developing POCs on notebooks for IT to deploy.
I participated in training with and had the support of the IT and Data Eng. department for questions and infrastructure, but for the rest I was alone.

Now, in the new AI eng. Role, I am in a similar situation, with the promise that the team will be expanded in around 1 year's time. The company is small and I am the only one dealing with AI and DS, even if there is a Business intelligence (DAs and DEs) team I haven't interacted with much yet.

Being in a ""one-man band"" is not so bad, generally, I did have strict deadlines and I was able to choose the technologies to use (e.g. I gained a lot of experience using docker, MLflow, SQL, and Spark), in the new company I am spending 95% of the time developing POC using the frameworks, VectorDBs, and infrastructure of my choosing, therefore, I am learning the job pretty fast.

On the other hand, I'm starting to question if the lack of working in a more structured team will damage my career in the long run. In the end, working alone made me pretty good at prototyping and developing in Python, but very weak in the deployment and monitoring part of the DS worlds (I am so concerned about this, that I also took a 6 month Data Eng. professional certificate in my free time). One person can only reach so far...

I am pretty passionate about my job and I am not the ""It is just a way to pay the bills"" kind of guy, with a healthy dose of ambition, I would say.

So, what should I do? Pushing to search for another job in a more structured environment? Give this opportunity a bit more time? Am I being too catastrophic?

It is me who is supposed to work with engineering teams, dedicated DS teams and legal to get that change live and monitor its performance and KPIs.

I wish to transition to a different firm after 3 years with my current company, but the issue is most of them define the work i have done as Data analyst, with Data scientist roles requiring me to have worked on models , NLP and even RAG.

Should I park the thought of transition and try to learn model development from scratch (i know the basics from college but no practical usage other than pandas for some visualization)? how do i advertise that in my resume? a personal website? kaggle?

mka6046,1jii855,mosenco,"I have a master in computer engineering and because the job market is so bad right now, and while applying to random job, i managed to pass many steps for a data scientist position. I'm really confused about many things.

The role isn't specific but goes from data engineering -> analytics engineering -> data scientist -> business analytics. Given the data inside the company's data center, extract insight to help the company makes better decision

The open position was left by a guy who studied data science in a economics university.. But reading many job posting of ML engineering, data engineering, data scientist, business analytics, all goes with the same goal: ""given a set of data, create some insight and present it to stakeholders or the boards or business team to help them make decision""

what's crazy is that different companies requires different set of skills to do the same thing. Maybe someone will spend time to feature engineering to build a better ML model, and maybe in another company, this guy just SQL the dataset with better tables and with python or looker try to see what's going on with charts and graphs. So one guy studied economics, another guy computer engineering.

so in the end is the same thing? feature engineering = extract insight for data. give the new features into your ML model = present your insight to your stakeholders lmao

So if i start to work as a data analyst, learning how to extract insight from data, basically im improving to better feature engineering too so im improving also in a possible ML career?

But why a computer engineering person should be better to extract insight? if someone studied data science in university, other than SQL and pytohn, what they learn?",1,1743208886.0

> but ultimately prefer Excel's visuals for the deliverables

In defense of Excel - it's more than just an outdated tool. It's basically an extremely functional UI that many people have decades of experience in, and if you give them something in Excel, they can work with it in ways you might not even understand.

One of my projects helps prioritize certain transactions that an expert should look at further, and it started off having one primary user. After putting together our initial POC of the modelling, we realized the best and fastest way to get the results for him to use was by simply outputting it all as an Excel report. He can use his excel skills to transform the data in the ad hoc ways he needs to for each individual transaction to translate these recommendations into business value, and we didn't have to spend any time developing a UI that would have much less power and he'd be much less proficient in than Excel.

Now, we're extending this project to be used by dozens more people, none of whom are good at Excel. We're developing a UI now, but he's still going to get his behemoth excel reports and only use the UI for a couple of things, because the reports are frankly way more useful to him, and that's good for the business, so it's good for us too.

mj3q99c,1jgkdwa,tl_throw,"One way to structure optimization problems that I’ve found helpful is the **“SPECIAL”** framework, where

**S** = **Solution representation**   
**P** = **Population / Pareto front / archive** (or a single solution if you do single-objective)   
**E** = **Evaluation functions** (your objectives)   
**C** = **Change functions** (mutation, crossover, etc.)   
**I** = **Initialization function** (to get starting solutions)   
**A** = **Acceptance/rejection rules** (non-dominated filtering, simulated annealing acceptance, etc.)   
**L** = **Loop** (the iterative process until stopping — e.g. combine / rank / assess / truncate / generate etc.)

This framework is flexible, in your case:

**Evaluation functions**

First, you need objectives (i.e., evaluation functions), like:

* total time from start to finish (makespan)
* number of violated dependency constraints  (or total time of tasks starting before upstream requirements have completed)
* number of setups required or total time spent on setups / shutdowns
* total idle time for machines, if applicable
* ... ideally measures of variance of the above (best/worst case times for schedule resilience)

I’d recommend to focus on these objectives *before* you think about how to represent solutions or which algorithm to use, because they’re implementation-agnostic and you can use them in many different underlying algorithms. Another thing is to think about constraints as objectives. Later, you can potentially handle them differently (for instance, you might make constraint-violating solutions impossible to reach based on your representation and change-functions, or you penalize them with ±∞ so they never get accepted). But initially, I’d just think of them as things to minimize, not prevent.

**Representation and algorithm**

Once you have the objectives, you have two options: combine them into a single metric (if you believe there’s really just one “best” solution) and do single-objective optimization, or keep them separate and do multi-objective optimization.

***Single-objective optimization*** requires you to merge everything into one objective, like “hours + (1e10 × no. of violations) + ….” I see you mentioned in a comment that you’re thinking of using  
((alpha \* sum of earliness) + (beta \* sum of tardiness) + (theta \* sum of setup times)).

The benefit of single-objective optimization is that it’s easy to set up. For single-objective problems, I strongly recommend **simulated annealing** or parallel tempering unless you have a good reason to use a different algorithm. Simulated annealing is simple, adapts well to tough constraints, and you can find “adaptive” versions that avoid fiddly temperature schedules.

Ok, so what's the problem with single-objective optimization? The downside is that most of the complexity/work gets folded into designing the cost function. Your note about having to decide alpha, beta, and theta somehow is really the crux of the challenge with single-objective optimization:

* there’s usually no obvious way to decide how many units of earliness are “equivalent” to one unit of tardiness, or how many setups are worth an hour of tardiness;

* you can get stuck in the tradeoff between ""what's optimal in the real world"" vs. ""what's optimal for the algorithm"";

* it’s hard to extend if you want to change your objectives down the line — you then have to figure out the “best” alpha, beta, and theta all over again;

* it also assumes that there’s basically only one good solution rather than a set of tradeoffs, which is almost never the case in reality.

 So I’d strongly recommend…

***Multi-objective optimization*** which keeps objectives separate and shows you the tradeoffs. These algorithms give you a *set* of non-dominated (Pareto-optimal) solutions, so you can pick the solution (in this case job schedule) that best balances your different objectives. In your example, you’d see the best tradeoffs among earliness, tardiness, and setup times.

One benefit of this approach is it’s really flexible. For example, say the company later realizes they also want to consider dependency violations, material costs, customer value / urgency, etc. You can just add these alongside your original objectives and see if there are good schedules that could be improved by buying new machines or molds. I don’t know the full context for your project but this could make things a lot easier later on.

The best general-purpose algorithm is a genetic algorithm called **NSGA-II** — it’s well-known, by far the most commonly used, and easy to implement (plus there are great packages for it). If you’re unsure about it, you could implement **SEMO** (one of the basic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) as a test (see *Empirical Comparison between MOEAs and Local Search on Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimisation Problems* — https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3638529.3654077). There’s also **SPEA2**, which I like, but it’s more complicated to code. NSGA-II is the best place to start and usually performs well.

**Other things**

There are lots of other things, e.g., how you’re going to represent solutions mathematically (machine assignments, mold usage, job order, etc.) and how you’ll design your change functions (mutation, crossover, swaps, etc.) to efficiently explore the possible solutions... But first I’d define your objectives functions separately so that later you can test any algorithms you want to. This is usually easier if you treat constraints as objectives (to be minimized) rather than relying on a particular underlying representation.

P.S. Sean Luke’s *Essentials of Metaheuristics* — [https://cs.gmu.edu/\~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf) — is a really good resource here, highly recommend.",5,1742621240.0

mj5ks64,1jgkdwa,cordialgerm,"My suggestion would be to break the problem into an outer and inner loop. The outer loop is ""strategic"" and controlled by the GA and fixes high level strategic parameters. Then the inner loop uses CP or LP to find the optimal solution given the strategy chosen by the outer strategic solve.

With this design, the inner loop won't generate infeasible solutions unless the strategy given by the outer genetic algorithm is an impossible strategy, in which case you simply penalize the fitness function heavily.

You can encode idle time as dummy jobs in your gene but I would try to avoid this if it's possible to instead represent the idle times as constraints within the inner LP/CP. That avoids a lot of additional very sparse solution space that your GA has to explore. Maybe you can specify idle time policies or strategies in your gene and then the LP/CP solves for the optimal idle times given the choice of policy.

That aside, yes, there are jobs where your understanding of data science is correct and I fully agree with your premises on coding, stats and general competence in your toolkit. My definition of DS is even broader than that.

Generally speaking, if an individual makes a sweeping statement, typically it has to do with one of three things. 

1) The individual saying such things is deeply insecure and needs to feel right, certain or in control - or: 

2) they learned it that way and are convinced that what they're saying is right but haven't recently questioned their assumptions (often because people have enough stuff to do other than continuously questioning themselves). Basically just humans being human, and having a limited horizon. 

3) And sometimes people state their opinion - and that's all: an opinion they have, that isn't prescriptive and that shows their worldview  - rather then being a generalisable statement about the entirety of the world. Then it is upon us to apply our critical listening/thinking/ reading skills.

In any of these cases way let's focus on treating these individuals with kindness rather than frustration.  🧡

The way to dissolve these ""issues"" is to enter into a conversation of why they think ""A"" is true, whether they're also stating ""A"" is true for more than just themselves and whether they think that ""B"" (your point of view) is excluded from the definition of ""Data Science"" and why? 
Some people will make a more nuanced statement, others will exclude you from their definition. You may state that the way you see it, ""Data Science"" encompasses both A and B.

misso8h,1jf8uwm,save_the_panda_bears,"Here are some tips I've found based on some quick research and some anecdotal evidence using my personal LinkedIn.

Your ultimate goal should be to show up in the recruiter [Spotlight Search](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/learning-center/tip-sheets/en-us/PrioritizeWarmLeads_wSpotlights.pdf). Spotlight search is a filterable list of candidates that LinkedIn deems likely to ""engage with you and your organization"" based on a [combination of factors](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a414283/spotlights-in-recruiter?lang=da).

How do I do that you may ask? Well, it seems to be a lot like the techniques companies use in SEO to show up at the top of search engine results. Some tips:

* Open to Work. This is a pretty clear signal to recruiters that a candidate is in fact, open to work. Imagine that. However, your ""Open to Work"" status becomes less of a signal if you keep it on for an extended period. Anecdotally, periodically turning it off for a couple days then back on results in an uptick in recruiter messages, as it seems like the recruiter search prioritizes newly open to work candidates. I would also use fairly broad role titles here if possible. You're trying to cast a wide net, but not too wide. From personal experience, you'll also seem to get more messages if you work at a company that has recently experienced layoffs. 

* Make sure your profile is seen as ""active"". This includes periodically updating your profile details, responding to messages, occasionally updating your profile picture, and playing the icky social media game of engaging with silly content. In my experience, replying to messages is a VERY important signal, even if your response is a ""thanks but no thanks"". Be prompt about it, it seems to works better if you reply quickly to individual messages instead of letting them pile up for a bit and replying to a bunch of them in a single go. 

* Company connections and company interest. This is specifically [called out](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a414283) as the only filterable criteria in the Recruiter Lite tool. Make sure you have connections at a company and have either engaged with a company's content or have clicked that ""interested in this company button"".

* Location - this seems to matter a little less, but it does help a recruiter filter to find local candidates. I would use this if you live in a major market, it's not as helpful if you live in a smaller city. For me, this hasn't made that much of a difference.

* Profile keywords - make sure you have the appropriate keywords in your profile that match the type of job you're looking for. Look for commonly used keywords in job postings and slap those babies all over your profile. Add some skills that match and now you got a real soup going.

* Complete your profile - make sure you have all the main sections of your profile filled out. This is free content space for you to stuff full of buzzwords and nonsense that make your profile more likely to pop up in search results. There's not a specific filter in spotlight search for this, but it does seem like you'll get a more steady stream of messages if you have more detail in your profile.",4,1742480508.0
mip4ibm,1jf8uwm,raharth,"For a while I got tons of messages, every week there was one in my inbox. This has changed significantly, now it's down to maybe one every two months or so. I cannot tell you what exactly has changed though (my profile hasn't)",4,1742422768.0
mip41wf,1jf8uwm,AHSfav,I've gotten contacts from about 10 recruiters over the last 4 months.  Mix of contracting and recruiters for internal jobs. Things I did that may have done something were putting open to work and putting a domain knowledge (whatever that is for you) in title and obvious in profile. In general fuck recruiters though.  Theyre incredibly duplicitous and flaky and in general just awful,3,1742422625.0
miq0kdt,1jf8uwm,Delicious-View-8688,"For me, I also had nobody contact me before my first job.
But almost within a few months after starting my first job, I would get weekly requests to connect or messages for opportunities. It's been a decade, and this hasn't stopped - even in the driest times, I still got contacted monthly.

I've heard a few things about this process:
- yes, keeping your Linkedin profile very detailed and active does help with the recruiters' search
- even if you reject opportunities, it is a good idea to at least reply with ""I'm not open to opportunities at the moment"" or ""I don't think I would be a good fit for this particular job"". Whether, and how quickly, you respond apparently shows up to recruiters.
- turn that ""open to opportunities"" on.


Edit:

A couple more things I just thought might be relevant:
- Recruiters are non-technical. So they probably search for very specific things like years of experience, past job titles, names of specific tools and technologies and... certifications. Like, the company will say ""we use SageMaker on AWS, so it might be helpful if the candidate has some familiarity""; the recruiter will go forth and search ""sagemaker"" and ""aws"" - and perhaps you'd miss out if you only mention Azure Databricks... Don't think certs will help you actually get the job, but I have a suspicion that it will help you get found by recruitment agents.
- I think early on, it helps to ""like"" or comment on posts made by others in the field/region, rather than posting your own content. Don't spam comments on people who have 100k followers, you'd get burried. But leave a good comment on a fairly accomplished person within the city (think 500~1000 connections), then you may reach your target audience a lot easier, without being lost in the crowd.",2,1742433342.0
miqdp97,1jf8uwm,the3rdNotch,"I just got a new role via a recruiter that reached out on LinkedIn.  I am not sure what career level you are at, but I was a senior MLE and then a ML manager before transitioning to an SLT role last year. I'm surprised to hear you are not attracting recruiters, even the junk ones. I was regularly receiving anywhere from 5-7 recruiter requests per week.

There are 2 things I would check. First, make sure you have set your profile to show recruiters that you are open to exploring new opportunities. I think this is the largest contributing factor on LinkedIn since they implemented the feature. I recently turned mine off due to just starting my new role, but I was still being inundated with recruiters wanting me to look at roles closer to my previous level. Since toggling it off, I haven't gotten a single request from a recruiter.  Second, when a recruiter does reach out to you using ""In Mail"", respond to them. Even if the opportunity is not at all a good fit. In Mails cost the recruiter money, but if you respond within a certain time frame they get the credit back. Recruiters can see how often you respond to In Mails, and many will prioritize those with a higher response percentage. They'll do this because not only will they get the credit back, but it also shows them that you're active on LinkedIn.

As a possible 3rd item. I have nothing more than anecdotes, but I also noticed a significant uptick in recruiters when I started interacting more on LinkedIn. Mostly just reacting to posts and occasionally providing comments was enough for me to appear higher in search results. I suspect the platform tries to create some sort of positive feedback loop be bumping you towards the top if you're regularly contributing any kind of content.",2,1742437952.0

miiclhn,1jeg1xn,ClasslessHero,"> The issue is something that is probably well understood by everyone here. The data is horrific, the asks are unrealistic, and expectations are through the roof. 

I worked at a big consulting firm in the US and this problem was rampant. In case you, or someone else reading this, hasn't heard it, here's the playbook:

- Document all of the problems, put together a deck that explains them in plain language, as little jargon as possible. **End with suggestions or possible paths forward** (big hint: you get to tell the story you like the most.) Do not detail the problems without proposing solutions. That is a critical error.

- Once you have buy-in within your team, bring these issues and proposed solutions to your client. Ask your client if they're aware of these issues and if they have any solutions for you. They may, or may not, that's not what's important. You want to document that these unknown issues exist for the sake of the contract.

- If your client has solutions to your problem, implement them. If they don't, then implement your solutions. The only wrong answer is saying ""too bad.""

- Build the best solution possible.

Here's why this works - your boss is happy. Your client feels they got the best product possible *and* they learned about their data. The contract is also safe because *these issues were unknown at the time of signing the deal.*

The big thing I'd point out - senior leadership in client service is evaluated on selling the work. It's their job to understand client goals and prescribe solutions to keep the contracts coming. They know these things won't be perfect, so they rely on talented people to *deliver the best work possible while building and maintaining relationships.* **That is the skillset you develop in the client service world, and it applies to every job, whether you realize it or not.** If you master that skillset, then there is no limit to how high you can go.",75,1742333018.0

\- Politics: sometimes big corp have weird politics, and your superior may get into position they need to sell something. It doesn't justify everything, and it sucks, but huge organisations have a lot of waste.  
\- Cultural: Some of those companies are very risk averse, and the culture of innovation and failing fast is not present. The fact that you work for months on a problem without knowing the threshold of success is a clear sign that the organisation doesn't have a good methodology and don't know how to fail fast.   
\- Resistance to change: I have had the case that the model is good enough but the client is reluctant to adopt because they have to change the current process. Yes ML will always have errors, in order to get the values one has to adapt the process to manage the errors and the risks. But people sometimes want to avoid responsibility so they don't change anything.

All that is to say I don't have the silver bullet solution but some of those things may help:  
\- Working backward: design the target process with the client BEFORE working on the model: how would they use it, how to manage errors, how to monitor and refresh the model. Use some conservative assumptions about model performance, you can find those in forums or on kaggle on similar cases.  
\- Fail FAST: predefine things required to continue the projects. In the same time, anchor the investments from the clients and the sponsors if you achieve the milestones. That's more of your managers jobs but you can still contribute.  
\- Agile small team: if you work in a silo, there is very little chance of success. Meet the model user every week, if possible every 2 days. Onboard devs, onboard legal etc.. Don't wait for the model to be ready to show them, show some data exploration, show some weird cases. You will learn a lot and the client will better understand your final results and adopt them  
\- Get involve in the non-technical discussion: This may not what you sign for as a technician, but if you don't hate it, I highly recommend start doing it. First it will tremendously boost your value (-> compensation) and make you evolve to senior role faster. And you will also learn alot about non technical skill (communication, business strategy, negotiation) that are very helpful. 

Hopefully this can help somehow.",7,1742336223.0
miitbsr,1jeg1xn,Ok_Time806,"I work predominantly with manufacturers, so there's already a pretty strong grasp on continuous improvement frameworks. I think cross functional data teams work great with these types of frameworks (e.g. DMAIC, PDCA, etc.). Even if you don't follow exactly, the definition step is critical for any project. Describe the current state, goals/milestones, and champion/stakeholders, budget, and timeline. Doesn't have to be very formal or time consuming to be effective.

I see many ML projects fail by not defining these simple things in writing, just like I've seen many non-ML projects fail for similar reasons.

mi803mj,1jd5wub,mcjon77,"My favorite, from a data analyst perspective, is Margin Call, there's probably a bunch of stuff that it gets wrong in terms of finance, but what I really like are the little things regarding how they portray an analyst interaction with non-technical leadership. 

The very first thing that struck me was the big layoff scene at the very beginning.  This is a fairly realistic view of how Mass layoffs happened, even though I didn't get to witness Mass layoffs first hand until after seeing the movie. I've seen two large layoffs with two different multi-billion dollar companies and they were very similar to that scene, except the person usually got a call or message on teams to go into an office as opposed to someone actually walking by and tapping them on the shoulder. 

In terms of the analyst specific topics I loved how at each level up the leadership ladder when the analyst would show the charts the manager would say something to the effect ""what am I looking at I don't understand what this is"" and the analyst or the manager below would have to point out the key figures for them to look at.  This is a critical thing that I had to learn in my career that just displaying data isn't the same as telling a story with data that's easily understood by someone who doesn't live with the data.

My favorite scene was the boardroom scene with the CEO. What I liked about the scene was that the analyst used their technical skill to identify a problem and explain it to the leadership, however the analyst didn't have the full picture.  The CEO actually had a perspective (probably from his personal interactions with his peers and other companies) that the analyst didn't know. If you recall, the analyst had a model that showed ""the music slowing down"" and that's what he thought was happening.  The CEO knew that ""the music has stopped"".  So he was able to take that information and make the appropriate decision to save the company. 

As an analyst or data scientist that's part of our role. Our models, visualizations and reports don't dictate policy but they should give leadership additional information and perspective to combine with what they already have to fashion a (hopefully) more informed policy.",35,1742194717.0

mi3nfk4,1jclsn8,SummerElectrical3642,"I managed an NLP specialist team and hired a “generalist” a few years ago. Let me share what could work for you: 
•	You need to demonstrate strong ability and a willingness to learn. 
•	The team is not in urgent need of immediate expertise, so they can give you time to learn while gradually taking on more complex tasks. 
•	You should have a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and some hands-on experience with NLP topics.

How to Get There in 6 Months

(I believe it would take 3-6 months, which is a reasonable timeframe when switching fields.) 
1.	Build a strong foundation in Deep Learning, Transformers, and LLM theory. •	You should be able to explain and understand these core concepts clearly. 
2.	Work on real-world NLP side projects using LLMs. •	This will help you gain practical experience in fine-tuning models and evaluating their performance. •	For example, you could build a workflow that filters job offers for you or even writes applications—projects that not only help you learn but also assist in your job search. 
3.	Take on 1-2 Kaggle challenges involving training or fine-tuning a Transformer model. •	Don’t just run a public notebook—really try to optimize your approach and aim for a top score. •Even if you don’t reach the top, being able to explain what didn’t work and what you learned from it is valuable.

Additional Advice

If you can’t get into a specialist NLP team right away, consider joining a team where you can work on a mix of NLP and non-NLP projects. This will help you gain experience applying NLP in a professional setting.

By the way, even the teammate I hired took more than a year to catch up with the rest of the team on all technical topics. So don’t worry if you struggle at the beginning—it takes time, but the learning process is very rewarding.

Understand the intuition and build your breadth in the subject and maybe when time permits, you can implement from scratch.",8,1742145043.0
mi5zzjd,1jclsn8,Gostai11,"1. **Take a course on ML fundamentals** - I would spend anywhere from 2-4 months taking ML/DL courses. Starting with ML (ie. dimensionality reduction, classical ml, and basic dl models). There are many free or affordable courses on Coursera, EdX etc. I would personally recommend the **Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera** as it is quite popular for beginners. If you want to go for a single course do the **Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University also on Coursera**, or the **Machine Learning Fundamentals course by UCSD on EdX**.

2. **Read up on ML basics** - Find a good textbook to help you understand the concepts behind the code, and how to formulate code to build a model. A very popular textbook is **O’Reilly Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow**. Here’s a link to a free copy of the 2nd Edition: http://14.139.161.31/OddSem-0822-1122/Hands-On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow-2nd-Edition-Aurelien-Geron.pdf[O’Reily Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow 2nd Edition](http://14.139.161.31/OddSem-0822-1122/Hands-On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow-2nd-Edition-Aurelien-Geron.pdf)

3. **Work on an ML project** - Start working on a project using what you learned so far. You should now be able to use various dimensionality techniques(PCA, MDS, t-SNE etc.), classical ml models — SL techniques (Linear/ Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods,  SVMs etc.), and UL techniques (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering etc). Find a good dataset (something both unique and with a decent number of features preferably) and start using some of the aforementioned ML models. Share your project on GitHub and if possible also share a report discussing the project.

4. **Take a course on DL** - **The Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera by Andrew Ng and Younes Mourri** is popular, it comprises of 5 courses so it will take some time to get through but it is worth it in my opinion. Alternatively, you can do the **Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras, and Tensorflow professional specialization offered by IBM on Coursera**. I would recommend the first specialization over the later, but the choice is ultimately yours.

5. **Take a course on NLP** - There a less options for NLP courses, the most popular one I came across was the **Deep Learning specialization by Eddy Shyu**, it has4 courses so it’s quite heavy but I would suggest that the first two courses are a must for understanding NLP.  And the later two courses are more focused on LLMs.

6. **Build DL and NLP project** — Now I would suggest you start building projects using DL and NLP and share those on GitHub. Perhaps even enter a Kaggle competition, if you feel that you’re ready. 

7. **Collaborate and update on current Research** - Try collaborating with others if possible. Work on some projects or research. Also now that you have understood basics, read up on current research, it’s okay if you don’t understand everything.

8. **Google/DeepSeek/ChatGPT/Gemini etc.** — These are excellent tools for solidifying your knowledge. Ask them to quiz you, or explain concept to them to see if your understanding is correct, or to check your code etc. The sky is your limit.",9,1742164625.0

mib3rio,1jd44gj,MarathonMarathon,"I'm currently a non-international junior at a state school trying to get into data analytics, data science, or data engineering. I'm proficient in Python, including several DS / ML libraries, as well as R and SQL. Unfortunately, I've struggled to land interviews for internships (any and all that I consider myself qualified for), let alone internships themselves, for both last summer and this summer, and considering it's March already and I have less than 1.5 years till graduation, I'd say things are looking absolutely hopeless.

(I'm told my failure might be partly explained by simply not applying to enough; I have a little under 200 total internship applications, but those are mostly concentrated in my metro area unless the company was large enough. Others have told me I should've applied to at least 600. Last year I was applying all over the place.)

I'm not the type of person who'd consider anything below FAANG or FAANG-adjacent as failure. Beggars can't be choosers and all that. I just want some paid work experience in CS, and so far, I only have unpaid work experience in CS and paid work experience in non-CS. I'm told looking for FTOs without any internship experience is like showing up to a gladiator fight without any weapons.

If I truly can't land anything, it looks like I'll have to spend my 20s working long shifts of retail / teaching kids Python while living with my parents and grinding LeetCode. I've seen people suggest delaying graduation just to remain eligible for internships, but my parents have told me that's a stupid idea, especially if I still can't find any internships, and recommended that I look into a Master's instead.

If I go with the grad school route, how would that even work? Should I do those online Master's programs like GT OCSMS, or are those a waste? Should I apply to an MS in data science, machine learning, or some other field like cybersecurity? (I heard an MS for general CS wouldn't benefit me.) Should I go to my state school for a MS (my parents personally know my department dean, and I could save money on tuition b.c. in-state and housing b.c. commuting), or should I aim for more prestigious programs? How competitive are Master's programs, especially compared to internships? (I've been told that most grad schools have around a 10% admissions rate regardless of school prestige.) How competitive are good rec letters from professors; do you need to be like top 10 of the class? Because I honestly doubt I am. Would lacking real research experience hurt my chances? Would I be eligible for internships the summer after senior year and before my Master's, or would pursuing a Master's only give me 1 extra year of eligibility?

AFAIK the timeline would be:

- now: get rec letters; keep GPA up; prepare for GRE; apply for what little internships + research opportunities are left

- summer: work a CS job if by some miracle I get one this late, or a regular McJob; apply to off-season internships; prepare for and eventually take GRE

- fall: apply for FTOs severely underprepared; apply to Master's programs; keep senior grades up

- next spring: receive acceptances / rejections for grad schools

Things just feel absolutely hopeless and I feel like I wasted my parents' money. They were kind enough to pay for my undergraduate tuition in full, which I understand is a massive privilege a lot of students wish they had, and after talking with them they said they'd be able to *partially* support a Master's if I pursue one. Hopefully I can get a paid TA or research position or something there. (I hear a lot of people in this industry manage to start out with a low FTO and complete a Master's concurrently to upskill, some companies even supporting them, but in my situation I'd be lucky to even have that luxury.)

* master’s degree in econometrics, bachelor’s in economics
* Led an operations team at a high-growth startup, scaling revenue 10x
* Strong SQL & Python skills (regression, time series forecasting, other statistical models that fit the hypothesis - learned all of this in grad school), experience in SAS, R

* Dashboarding and visualizations  (Looker, Tableau)
* Worked closely with execs and data teams to improve data warehouse

miw5ae1,1jd44gj,noone011235,"Hi! Hoping for some advice re: MSDS programs. I know this is a frequently recurring topic, but I super appreciate any advice you can provide :)

I'm currently deciding between the following two programs: **M.S. Statistics & Data Science at Yale and M.S. Data Science at Columbia.** Both Yale and Columbia are 1.5-year programs, and my question is – as folks / experts in the field, **what are your immediate knee-jerk reactions when you hear the two?**

I'm ultimately looking for which program will be fun to attend, which to me would mean a combination of (1) a robust graduate student network, (2) student-faculty relationships, and (3) location. A fast-follow priority is perception – that is, how would you feel if you saw either program on my resume, all else equal?

Columbia takes the cake with #1 and #3, but I can't help but get a ""sleazy"" cash cow feel from them (e.g., they only provide 2 weeks to accept their offer and submit a $4k deposit. Their website also feels like an advertisement, and I can't even get confirmation that it's a 1.5-year program from it).

On the other hand, Yale flew me out, maintains an intimate cohort of 15–20 graduate students, and master's students study alongside PhD students with tenured faculty (#2). All while being in less-than-ideal New Haven with a seemingly disjointed graduate student cohort and a grad dining hall that's only open Mon–Thu for lunch! You catch my drift.

Any inclinations you have towards either program are super appreciated :) Firsthand experience with either one of the programs is doubly appreciated!!

**Additional Context**

* I'm super fortunate to be fully funded (tuition-wise) by my employer, with the stipulation that I must return for 2 years after finishing my program. Therefore, cost of attendance is not a huge factor
* However, there is potential for me to find a competing offer that offsets the cost of attendance salary-wise, so network / career opportunities / resume boost are still important to me. My current job is in consulting, so there is an additional impetus for me to pursue this route (versus somewhat unrelated job experience post-MS)
* My background is in Math (from a strong undergrad, for what it's worth) with coursework and a thesis in Statistics, but I've worked in management consulting since graduating
* Also am grateful to have UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, CMU, and a few others back pocket, but ultimately think it will come down to Yale or Columbia. Have I missed something here?",1,1742516535.0

But, if the role is more focused on algorithms and full-stack, then yeah. You should understand how to develop and deploy a model.

I’ve done both from startup to big tech, last job was DS at Google.

Here's the ML framework to walk through in interviews.

1. **Frame the problem** \- *do you want batch or realtime prediction? What’s the prediction point? (Eg, predict user churn after first session or every month?) what’s the prediction granularity? (Eg forecast at item level, department level or total level?)*
2. **Data Sources and Preparation** \- *discuss the data you need. Be specific about tables and fields like user and transaction table. And how you will prep and clean the raw data.*
3. **Feature Preparation** \- *newbies typically skip this part. But don’t. Discuss how you engineer and select features for model. Discuss how you mitigate collinearity.*
4. **Model Selection** \- *Discuss which algo you will use. When in doubt, just use random forest or XGBoost. Discuss cross validation and parameter tuning.*
5. **Model Evaluation** \- *Discuss metrics you will use. If it’s regression, use mae, mse. If it’s classification, use AUC. Be mindful of accuracy vs AUC.*
6. **Deployment** \- *Bonus if you can talk about it. If you need realtime, you need an API and host it on AWS lambda, or have a dedicated ec2 server. If it’s batch, you can just use airflow or any other services that does chron jobs, and ingest the output of the data in a database like Postgres.*

To see this in action, I'd suggest you check out the [Amazon ML case](https://youtu.be/MAGaQ7POPCI?si=j2zV8FgMwouirTOQ) and [Regression Modeling Framework](https://www.datainterview.com/courses/case-in-point/machine-learning-regression-modeling-framework-v) where he walks through the solution end-to-end.",121,1741948978.0

1. What's done
2. What are the roadblocks/waiting
3. What's in progress
4. What's on deck
5. Important dates
6. Important questions

  
With the stonewalling, the roadblocks/waiting section will fill up and it'll block everything else. I usually give it to my management as their todo list for me. It's also a check to see if I'm doing useless work. These will hang around in the 'What's on deck' section.

miapkqn,1javfus,dfphd,"So, first things first - what you're describing is a standard dysfunctional DS environment. It is typical of companies where the representation of DS and Analytics ends relatively low in the corporate hierarchy. There is no understanding of how things work, and most importantly there is no interest in developing an understanding in how things work - instead, people are encouraged to just ask DS to do things faster because, TBH, it will likely get them what they want.

Obviously the issue is two-fold:

1. They get what they want, which is overwhelmingly likely not what they need nor what they should be asking for.

2. They burn their best talent out, and then those people leave.

The only true solution to the entire system is to actually hire a Director or VP of DS/Analytics who has experience actually being a data scientists to start whipping up other functions into shape. But that's not happening.

As for your specific situation in a vaccum, again to be clear - you're in a bad spot. Because basically if you don't ask questions, your boss says you're holding things up for not asking questions. If you do ask questions, you're holding things back by asking bad questions. 

Here's what I would do:

>""you're not asking the right question! you're not supposed to ask people to do YOUR work for you""

Any time someone says ""that's not what you should do"", then, with the happiest most ""can do"" tone you can muster, you tell them ""oh my god, thank you so much for that feedback I have been feeling like maybe I'm not focusing on the right stuff. Could you please give me some pointers on what *you* would want me to do instead? If we can spend 5 minutes working through this specific scenario that will help me avoid that in the future and be more effective"".

There are three ways this can play out:

1. They're right and give you some legit feedback that helps you work better

2. They're wrong and through the conversation they are able to maybe concede that you weren't asking bad questions or at least stop implying that you are

3. They refuse to do that altogether, at which point you know what you're dealing with.",1,1742234258.0

If you’ve got experience with the former then you’ve probably got a good mental model for using the latter, and just need practice with the actual mechanics of doing things in SQL. Having that mental model of declarative, set-based data manipulation is far more important than just knowing how to write SQL code, so you’re in a good spot there. 

I was in a similar position to you a while back. I used SparkSQL in both Scala and Python day in and day out, but it’d been years since I worked in SQL itself.

Not bad results, sufficiently proven good results. None of his solutions ever worked - they made things worse. Higher ups didn't even want to use his solutions on rare occasions when they performed better (although this could be because evaluation is bad). The things he cared for were not of theoretical or practical relevance. It seemed to me like he was a disgruntled paper reviewer that was just looking for reasons to weak reject your paper. And like, instead of working to solve issues, he was just working to sate his curiousity.

The solution was... him leaving the company. There's really nothing I could've done because the work culture was just so off. No one does what they're supposed to, but they like to intrude on others' work and criticize it. Not just mine, everyone gets this. And often times the only reason you were proposing a solution they sprinted to criticize is because the things they were responsible for broke! We're at a situation where maybe 1 or 2 of us produce reliable solutions, and everything else is unreliable. I hand label data now for gods sake because even the experts on this are wrong.

But the good thing is that this kind of culture makes work so insufferable and inefficient, that any improvements you make are good grounds for a promotion. So I tend to ignore this, do things right, and they usually produce good results. Then I can move on and hopefully some day be a team lead that puts and end to it. Should they be fired? No. It's just that people need to be told to do their damn job instead of looking for any occasion to boost their ego should one do a mistake, yet ignore all their mistakes.

mh6tk7t,1j87x92,tangentc,"So I don’t think random splits are inherently unreasonable. In most contexts validation on random splits is best practice. The issue is what you mean by replication- are you saying that he got a validation f1 score of 0.72 and you got 0.70 when trying to replicate? Because i wouldn’t immediately see this as a big problem. If he’s getting 0.72 and you’re getting 0.5 then there’s a more fundamental issue .

As someone else mentioned the basic solution is just to save the splits. But I’m also in a highly regulated space where the technology platform has been a moving target for a while and that can make large data storage tricky sometimes. 

But I question how important it is that you get exactly identical results when random splits are employed vs getting similar results, because you can also empirically estimate the uncertainty associated with the random sampling method by simply scoring against many random samples and showing how likely his results are given the variance you’ve observed.

Edit: none of this is to excuse general sloppiness. And I would say the actual end model *itself* should have exactly replicable outputs (and had to have this fight at work myself).

\- I just looked deeper into the angle calculation, and saw that your angle do not take into account the orientation of the train station's entrance. E.g. for Gare du Nord the majority of the restaurants have an angle of -170, since the train rails go to North.

mhssa9g,1j7q4w5,weatherghost,"Looking for some thoughts on best path forward.

I’m currently a scientist/meteorologist. Have Masters and PhD in atmospheric science which is a fairly quantitative field. Fairly comfortable with most things calculus and still somewhat comfortable with linear algebra. I’m comfortable with Python/Matlab, I’ve done plenty of data analysis and visualization, and atmospheric science is the original “big data” field so I’m fairly comfortable there. It’s been a while since I’ve done much of anything stats related, I’m not super confident with computer science or cloud computing (AWS etc), and I have a rudimentary understanding of ML topics. 

Much of my field is government funded and with the current attacks on NOAA, funding is looking insecure to say the least. So I’m looking to increase my skills in data science. This is partly to open up my options on private sector jobs in my own field (which asks heavily for ML-related data science) and partly to open my options outside meteorology (since fired government folks are going to flood the job market soon).

Any advice on courses I can take? If I want to get out of science/meteorology do I need to get an MS in stats/DS? Or are my current quantitative degrees relevant enough that a bootcamp/micro-masters/personal projects would be sufficient?

I’ll be starting my Master’s in Machine Learning by July next year, I have also figured out my finances so I won't have to struggle financially during my masters. Previously, I worked as a front-end engineer, but I’ve quit my job and started giving tuition to free up more time for learning ML.

My goal is to publish at least one solid research paper during my Master’s, which is why I’ve postponed starting the program by a year to establish a solid foundation. I also hope the Master's experience will help me decide whether to pursue a Ph.D. If I choose not to, I’m confident in my programming skills in general and I hope my masters would be of some use in that case.

I am transitioning into a data science role (coming from academic position in Pysics) and to make me more appealing to prospective employers I am working on a personal project to add to my portfolio.  
For context: I live (and expect to work) in the EU.  
So, the idea of my project is the following: I want to scrape as much data as I can from one of the major real estate websites of my home country, organize that data into a database and then use that data to make some interesting dashboards. The aim of this project should be that I am capable of webscraping, creating and organizing a database from scratch, and extract the data from the database for analysis and visualization. I would of course not use any personal data for this project.  
Now, it's clearly not a good idea to publish the scraped data itsel, but what about the dashboards? Would that still be considered intellectual property of the website I got the data from? Even if the dashboard only shows aggregate data and not data from for example single listings?

I also thought about the following thing. I could use the scraped data to train a ML model that generates similar data, which then I could use for the analysis and visualization. Would it be safer to put on my personal website the dashboards made with this generated data (the generated data itself would not be published)?",1,1742152952.0

mh5r4m0,1j7b4sg,heraldev,"hey! as someone who has built ab testing infra before, here's my 2 cents:

most companies overcomplicate this tbh. before jumping into fancy tools, id recommend starting with a solid feature flagging system - its literally the foundation for clean ab testing.

what we learned building Typeconf (shameless plug lol) is that having type-safe feature flags makes automated testing SO much easier. like u can define ur test configs as:

```
type ABTest = {
  name: string
  variants: {
    control: number
    treatment: number
  }
  targeting: {
    users: string[]
    segments?: string[]
  }
}
```

this way ur automation scripts can validate everything before deployment n catch issues early.

some practical resources:
- splitio has good docs on their architecture
- gitlab's feature flags guide is pretty solid
- theres a good o'reilly book on continuous delivery that covers this

the main thing is keeping it simple at first. start with basic feature flags, add metrics collection, then layer on the fancy stuff like automated analysis.

also pro tip - invest time in good monitoring/alerting for ur test infrastructure. nothing worse than realizing ur test has been broken for days 😅

mg3hcjg,1j39e2e,7182818284590452,"Here is a check list

1: Use only pyspark data frames and functions. No pandas. No numpy. No base python. 
2: Add a checkpoint after every join.
3: Add checkpoint after every loop with data frames in the body of the loop. 
4: Optimize the SQL tables. Z order, liquid cluster, etc.
5: Review evaluation and remove anything unnecessary. 
6: Monitor ram. If the data frame is larger than memory, spark will read and write to disk a lot which will cause a slow down. Get more ram if needed. Called spill.
7 Monitor CPU utilization. Should be 80% or more during execution. 

8: After all the above, throw more CPU threads or worker nodes at it. All tricks are exhausted.
 

Concerning 5, like others have said, lazy evaluation can cause repeat execution. display(df) followed by df.count() will cause all above code to be executed twice (assuming no checkpointing). 

The ideal use of spark and lazy evaluation is a single execution at the very last line of code. Everything above is just instructions. Obviously this is not always possible, but it is at least a good goal for performance. 

Concerning 8, spark really shines because of it's ability horizontally scale (multiple computers). It is not the fastest tool on just one computer. This will cost money. Working with 50 million rows in an interactive session is not fast or cheap thing by nature.",8,1741149998.0

Let's say you join two dataframes, then run a groupby average and show the results. Then you realize that you do not want the average, but you need the median. The spark will start from the beginning! It will join the tables again!

For counting specifically, check the largest value of the primary key (usually named id). This is way faster.

How do you import your data into spark, are you importing it from a hive store or a traditional SQL database. I am sensing the import of data from another system might be the bottleneck if you are doing it that way. That is why everything takes 40 mins regardless of the operation.

mg5hpqm,1j39e2e,TearWilling4205,"great solutions offered by experts regarding sampling and cluster environment. apart from these you can also try partition and group by.

for specific example you mentioned, finding null values in a df column.

say column A, you are trying to find null values.

then you can partition the data frame by a column B which has low cardinality e.g. customer\_type

then group by this column B and find groups with null values of required unique column A.

my understanding is this will create different  tasks running in different partitions providing results faster.

please note if any shuffle/sort is used, this can degrade the performance.

That said, do you need to work with all 100 columns at once? For example:

Be intentional with each operation with an end goal in mind (it should not be to run the entire data on a ML model).
Use SQL. It is optimized for DB operations. Not sure if spark is different.
Lastly, if nothing, ask for a fucking bigger computing cluster! 50M is NOT big data I would say.

The upgrades are designed to stack not additively, but multiplicatively, so that the player's damage increases exponentially as they take more upgrades. My goal is to determine by how much each type of upgrade will multiply a player's damage. Our game is currently live, and we're collecting analytics. Assume we have data that tell us which upgrades a player has and their damage per second while they have those upgrades. (Measured over the time they have that particular combination of upgrades)

Normally for this sort of thing I'd use ones-hot multiple regression, but that only works with linear combinations, and this data doesn't fit that. Instead of being a normal linear combination, like:

> Σ(a₁b₁, a₂b₂ ... aₙbₙ)

My data fits the pattern of

> Π(a₁?(b₁:1), a₂?(b₂:1) ... aₙ?(bₙ:1))

So, similar, but multiplicative instead of additive.

I post in this thread because I figure that regression of this type exists and is taught to real data scientists, so it qualifies as an ""Elementary Question,"" because I'm trying to find out where to start on this problem.  I read the FAQs (even though the link in the OP is broken) and this is not a homework question, nor am I attempting to crowdsource Google. (Believe me, if I knew how to google the solution, I would, but I don't know what terms to ask for. If you do, just send me a lmgtfy link and I'll be happy as a clam.)

Ive been studying DS/DE for over 5 years almost in my BSc and MSc and I feel like I'm not capable of landing a job in the field leading me to think this field is not the one for me.

During college I tried getting internships but due to personal stuff I wasnt able to, but I got 1 research fellowship and worked with a student's data company but I didnt get much from those experiences. Now during MSc I've been working with 2 companies as a consultant but I'm not being paid and most of the time there isnt work to do and when there is most of the work I do just isnt being used or showed to clients (companies are startups and are from people close to my circle who have invited me to work with them).

I don't really know what to do, working at big consultant companies seems just depressing to me and I dont see myself working at these really corporate companies without just becoming depressed. And in general I just feel like I'm not prepared for the job market and frankly just thinking about pursuing another thing. I do love data and using data to generate value in some way but this corporate stuff just really puts me in a depressing state that i dont know what to do.

mgx3hik,1j2b2ng,wompr,"It's been 10 months and I have had no luck finding work. 

Very very quickly, my background...you can skip to the end for my actual questions, but you can use this as reference. 

**Academic Bkg:** I live in Ontario, Canada. B. Eng in Electronics Systems Engineering. It was a very practical program - we had at least 1 engineering project every semester, sometimes multiple, amounting to 10 total. 

**Co-ops/Paid Internships**: Three in total. One at BlackBerry-QNX and One at Ciena. One was in a startup. All 3 were in the realm of high-level SWE. This taught me everything in my toolbox which landed me my jobs after grad. 

**Professional Experience:** First job, was in Data engineering - they provided all the training material and were patient, but got laid off due to lack of work. My second job was at a very famous Canadian company working for their automation team. At the end of probation, they terminated me due to lack of skill. Total YoE: 2 Years (1.5 + .5, respectively). 

**First 8 months:** I tried to focus on SWE fields, such as DevOps, and upskilling, but not doing the certs since my other SWE friends told me that just having it on your resume is a strong bait, but you will have to prove yourself in the interview. Just 1 phone screen. 

**Last 2 Months** Three of my friends who left their respective careers and became Data analysts talked to me and advised me to strongly consider DA or BA because it's got an easy barrier to entry and they all have stable jobs, so I took a big course, did a few personal projects, put on my resume and started applying. Not a single peep, just recruiters hopping on calls just to get my details and ghosting me immediately after I tell them I am pivoting to DA/BA. 

**Now**: I'm exploring my options. I am in a capable spot to pursue a master's and I want to see what's the best course of action for moving forward. I have already made 2 mistakes trying to upskill my DevOps and my DA, only to get nowhere because SWE favors experience over courses, and it also doesn't favor master's over experience either. So, I was open minded to look into other fields. 

______

1.	How is the job market for entry levels ? 

2.	I did DE for 1.5 years. Will that help my case ? 

3.	If I am an ECE bachelor’s, can I do DS as a masters, or is it too hard/too different due to prereqs ? 

4.	Can I pivot from 2 YoE in SWE to an entry-level just by doing courses online ? 

5.	What do I do to Level the playing field for myself at this point? 

10.	Will comprehensive Udemy courses filled with practical projects be enough to get my foot in the door ? 

6.	If I need to upskill on my own, how seriously do I need credentials – what level ? (ie. Udemy vs actual professional certs from AWS, or GCP)

7.	Will a Master’s level the playing field for me? 

11.  Is the industry like SWE where Professional experience >> courses and master's ? 

9.	Do I have a better chance looking for work in the US ?

I say this because when it comes to using synthetic data, the ""domain adaption"" from synthetic to real will depend on how the synthetic data was generated. Synthetic data is generated just the statistical properties of real data so any issues with it (or directions for improvements) will come from either a) making better choices on the statistics we use to describe the data, or b) using a different/updated dataset to calculate them. The first case is a methods problem, the second case is a distribution drift problem.

On feature engineering for non-time series data, which is quite a different subject, a big one you don't have listed is PCA. I'd also recommend checking out other dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP.

> Many statistical tests, machine learning algorithms, and imputation techniques assume a normal distribution, highlighting the importance of assessing normality. If in doubt, running the Shapiro-Wilk normality test or making Q-Q plots can confirm whether data follows a normal distribution. When data is skewed, applying transformations like a log transformation can help normalise the distribution.

There are very few common techniques which assume that any of the *observed variables* have any particular distribution. Especially in a case like this, when some of these variables look like they're going to be used is some kind of predictive model (e.g. a regression model, which makes absolutely no assumptions about the normality of *any* of the variables). It's also essentially always bad practice to explicitly test for normality (for many reasons, some of which are laid out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1iiouts/q_paired_ttest_for_multiple_variables/mb7j553/)). I'm not convinced that there's any reason to transform the observed variables at all during *exploratory* analysis, since you're not working with a model that makes specific assumptions about their distributions, or the relationships between them.

> Right-skewed distributions indicate outliers in the higher values

If the distribution is actually skewed, then the observations aren't *outliers*. They certainly shouldn't be removed.",11,1740774725.0

Use nixtla's cross validation to validate the performance of the models. Good statisticall models to try on your data are Theta, Simple exponential smoothing or Arima. 


As other have said LGBM is one of the best machine learning based models for time series data out there. Since you are modelling daily sales be sure to include all kinds of date feature engineering such as day of week, day of year, week and so on in your models and test if they improve the performance.


Lastly depending how big the difference between the models is, it can be beneficial to use an ensemble of multiple models instead of the best single model. The most effective approach to construct the ensemble is to formulate an optimization problem that minimizes prediction error on the validation set by assigning appropriate weights to each model, ensuring that their sum equals 1.",2,1740781487.0
mfh9810,1j029yl,seanv507,"

for sales data your basic building blocks are multiplicative relationships

eg maybe 10% of your sales come from brand x
and of that 10% 80% comes from items under 10$ and 20% comes from items above 10$

ie sales =brand effect x price effect x seasonality effect x ....

so you need to model log of sales, to turn it into an additive relationship that better suits linear regression/xgboost

(there is also poisson regression, also supported by xgboost)


multiple output problems are handled by leveraging hierarchical information

eg say your item is clothing
you might choose outerwear(coats)/inner wear
then tops/bottoms
then blouses/sweathshirts/tshirts



the aim is to build a model of the higher level, and use that for items with low sales history

you do that in linear regression by just adding all the hierarchy terms into your model and using l1/l2 regularisation to tune how much you use average information


i believe the standard regularisation features of xgboost will do the same. eg splitting on a top hierarchy level is (hopefully by design of your hierarchy) going to reduce the overall error more than  a split between sweatshirts and t shirts (as it covers fewer items)",2,1740856727.0

mfao7l8,1j0eptr,DanielBaldielocks,"To give some more details this is my idea on how to build this.

The file transfer stream tells me mainly 3 points of data;  File name, from folder, to folder

My idea is to first use regex to detect the file extension and then group by the combination of to/from folder and extension

Then within each of these groupings use some kind of text extraction to count how many file transfers there have been over say last 6 months with various filename patterns and someone intelligently which patterns have enough matches to justify considering it a naming convention.

For example if we have the following file names

someFile12302212025  
someFIle12301152025  
someFile123122122024

so it would start by taking the initial contiguous set of alpha text so in this example would be someFile

Then it, for each file, add subsequent characters and check how many match

so for the first file we would get  
someFile, 3 matches  
someFile1, 3 matches  
someFile12, 3 matches  
someFile123, 3 matches  
someFile1230, 2 matches  
someFile12302, 1 match  
etc

so then I could see that the largest number of matches was 3, and the longest string with 3 matches is someFile123.  So then I would consider this a naming convention and would assign any new files matching this pattern that also matches the to/from folder combo for these files.

  
The problem is that while I feel this would capture most naming conventions, it is really computationally intensive so I'm wondering if there is a more effectient way to do this.",1,1740768225.0

I think the key here is what is the ultimate goal of this pre-trained model. While the input may feature sentences ranging from vastly different subjects, the point is to gather semantic relationships between words and contexts and it should be general enough to span all subjects. That's the nice thing about language. It has a kind of reproducibility across domains.

I believe the end of sentence token is a natural way to feed the model an understanding that some of the tokens that come into the future that past the end of sentence token are going to reference some other subject.

OR is, in my opinion, the technical foundation of applied optimization. Some more modern ML/AI techniques may not be needed for your problems. Oftentimes the best approach is to formulate your problems as linear programs (LPs) or integer-linear programs (ILPs) and computing the solution with OR solvers (e.g. CPLEX, Google OR tools, etc.). 

I'd recommend first looking into what a basic linear program is, how to formulate real-world problems into linear programs, and how OR solvers move through the search space to find the optimal solution. Just understanding how to visualize a search space for a problem will do wonders for you as you start to think through more and more complex problems.

When averaged over all problems every digital optimization algorithm that does not repeat guesses will take the same average number of guesses.  A hill climbing algorithm will accidentally find the minimum just as fast as a hill descending algorithm when averaged over all possible surfaces.  

The escape from this hell is to choose an optimization algorithm that is superior for the subspace your problem domain lies in. Unfortunately this is usually an NP hard problem itself and must be discovered empirically.  But sometimes you do know enough about your surface to choose wisely

The other escape is that while that holds for the global optimum, if you would be satisfied with better worst case performance or a local minimum then some algorithms may be better.

Most people's reaction to learning this is disbelief. Unfortunately it's provable. 

But don't despair.  Most problems do lie in some subspace. And most people are satisfied with a sub optimal local
Minimum. Your job is to try different approaches and discover the what works best.

Ergo a book with a bag of tricks.

Many of these people do not have any real data science training or experience, but they may have a history with fancy titled.

2. There isn't a solid industry definition of what data scientists do. Many roles I've seen advertised can range from anything from data analytics, engineering, visualisation or just record management. I feel like data science became a buzzword for anything vaguely related to data.

3. During the pandemic and immediately following the publication of chatGPT, data science became super hot topic. During the pandemic I saw a lot of newbies to the industry promoted up into technical roles they weren't really qualified for because there simply were more DS positions than qualified applicants to fill them.

A couple weeks into the job, I meet this guy from another department who turns out to be some ‘assistant director’ of DS.

He does all his work in R which is fine, but apparently not very efficient since he’s always complaining to our team that he needs more compute. His team has their own dedicated server on prem. 

All his models seem to be poorly fitted GLMs and the only metric he would talk about is kappa regardless of the problem.

mevfwib,1iygj98,the3rdNotch,"There is way too much here to provide an accurate answer, but I’ll try and address the obvious items. 

Data Scientist is an ill-defined job role. At some companies a DS is nothing more than a DA/BA, at others they’re PhDs with years of research in a family of specific algorithms who can’t do any development outside of a Jupyter notebook. Then at others they’re seasoned developers that saw the need to start using ML to solve crucial business problems and they have a very narrowly defined domain expertise, but they’re able to write enterprise tier applications and libraries.

5 years ago, ML roles (DE, DS, MLE, etc.) were some of the highest paying career paths for entry level folks, and the demand far outstripped supply. This leads to people pursuing these roles even if they don’t have a core interest in the subject. These roles are still pretty high paying, so you’re going to just get a lot of candidates taking a chance to see if they can just break in.

Without knowing what your take home looks like, it’s possible you’re being unreasonable with what you’re asking for the time the candidates are willing to give. I’ve reached the point in my career where I refuse all assessments, and will not do any take-homes that estimate more than an hour. Combining 2 data frames is an easy thing to google, so if they can’t do that in a take home, that tells me something with your process is broken if they’re getting to that point and not being eliminated.

Assume skill is a standard distribution. Let’s also assume you are stock average. That means half will be below your skill level. You’re not average tho. To get to your level, you’re probably above average. That just means the grouping of people below your level is even greater.

The overall economic market kind of sucks and is uncertain right now. This shifts the average and high performing data folks to be more conservative in their approach to making a change. Those that can’t are either forced into the market or are more interested in making a move before they’re forced to.

You also seem to be more technically minded than leader minded. Don’t take this as an insult, it’s a completely normal thing. However, if you’re constantly questing for folks that are already at the level you want them to be, you asking for candidates that aren’t interested in growing. At that point, what is it that you’re offering them other than a paycheck? Part of your role as a leader is to guide, develop, and grow the talent of your teams. If that isn’t something you’re interested in, you need to go to your boss and figure out how to get that worked out. Otherwise you’re looking at always having under performers or ending up with good people that just take the job until they can find something better.",7,1740571979.0

First, for better or worse data scientist has become part of the career progression for data analysts and not every data scientist takes a scientific approach. For some people it’s just a job. 

Second, it’s possible that not everyone is up to your standards and it’s possible that your standards are not appropriate for the comp you pay and the work you do. If you pay $83k for in person work at a utility company, it’s probably going to be very hard to find someone with a PhD, a solid understanding of theory, the ability to be practical about that theory, and an ability to code that rivals a software engineer.

Third, it’s possible that as a leader you are focusing too much on science and not enough on leading people. It’s a common problem for analytics leaders to take on a team that lacks technical rigor. Of course sometimes changes in team composition are needed but great leaders raise the bar for the team and bring the team over that bar in a way that benefits the org.

Writing unit tests are a means to an end, not the end itself. Give me the PhD or masters in Economics, Biostats, statistics, etc. any day. I’ll get them what they need to know with dbt, docker, git, etc.

* **An engineer with a master's in data science from a leading university:** They seemed deeply insecure, avoiding any in-depth discussion of data science.

* **A former academic with a PhD in mechanical engineering:** Despite their extensive publications and experience with applied statistics, they exhibited defensiveness and an antagonistic interview style. Their questions were often poorly defined, and they resisted any attempts to enhance or alter problem. Their company's published statistical work revealed significant flaws (his name wasn't on it), like over-reliance on R\^2 and inappropriate use of PCA, which does track with his academic work from last decade. When I suggested using neural networks with added noise to address their small sample size issue, they dismissed adding noise forcefully with ""that does nothing"".

It was clear the companies engineers were struggling with basic analysis, that's not their forte, and were fixated on outdated methods. They are all smart, capable people, but maybe struggling with a difficult domain (what they are trying to do is not easy). It felt like they were projecting their insecurities onto me, despite my ability to address their challenges. It highlights a real issue: the field is vast, and no one can know everything. Yet, some individuals seem unwilling to acknowledge their knowledge gaps, leading to poor practices and a defensive attitude.

So if your tests results are non-significant in a large sample size, you intervention likely has no effect.

Statistical significance is generally not something that you ""reach"". It's simply the probability of observing an outcome of a given magnitude or higher under the null hypothesis falling under certain threshold.

That said, if the variance of your test statistic is very high, you can use regression adjustment based on pre-experiment covariates (aka CUPED) to increase statistical power.",139,1740521325.0
mesaecz,1iy6v4d,RepresentativeAny573,"Not trying to throw shade, but from your post it seems like you don't have a good understanding of how statistical models function.

Classic statistical tests were not built to work only on small sample sizes, that is completely false. All of these statistical tests will work better with more data. Components of the test were developed so that you could still achieve accuracy with small sample sizes, though more recent work indicates that 30 people is probably still too small for these tests to achieve high accuracy. For all tests, the more data you collect the more accurate the test gets.

Second, statistical significance is almost meaningless to look at with larger datasets. What you really want to know is effect size, which tells you how different the two groups are.

Finally if you are noticing that small sample tests are giving you drastically different results than larger sample tests and this happens every time you do these tests then you are almost certainly violating an assumption of the statistical test. There should only be a 5% false positive rate if you are truely conducting these tests correctly. Now in the real world, we probably have a lot of minor assumption violations that drive that error rate up, but if it is happening on all of your tests then you are almost certainly doing something wrong in your modeling process. It is really hard to say what that is without know more about your data and method though.

Just based on your post the problem might be optional stopping, where you keep testing your data as you collect it and stop once you hit statistical significance. That is a massive violation of the assumptions of these tests and will greatly increase your false positive rate. What you should do is run a power analysis to determine your sample size, collect that many samples, and only analyze after all of your data is collected.

Edit: also, just in response to the claim that modern approaches solve some accuracy problem with classic models, this is also not true. Most modern black box approaches were developed to deal with the massive amount of variables that are input into a model and there is no point using them for a simple A/B test. Of course if you're dealing with really complex distributions, time series, or something like that then you will need something fancier, but a simple regression where your only variable is who saw A and who saw B, and your outcome is pretty normal is totally fine.",133,1740523396.0

metqhi1,1iy6v4d,anglestealthfire,"There is a significant amount of context to get through to answer your question in any meaningful way, most of this relates to the underlying mathematics and statistical principles that underpin statistics.  

Generally, many of the statistical tests designed for small sample sizes approximate ones for large sample sizes as sample sizes increase - often related to asymptotic behaviours as n increases towards infinity (e.g. the students t-distribution will approximate a normal distribution more closely as sample sizes increase).  There is usually a very obvious reason why this happens when the mathematics underpinning the tests are examined.

Generally speaking, your random sample should approximate the reality (be more representative of) more closely as the sample size increases.  As such, the phenomenon of apparent effects with small non-representative samples may start to evaporate with larger random samples - if the pattern is not seen in the population you are attempting to infer to (i.e. the null hypothesis cannot be rejected).

There is an argument that averaging grossly using statistics can miss subpopulations in various contexts, however this relates to the assumptions needed.  This may be part of what you have heard that statistics may not have a place for large datasets.  Alternatively, people often say that classic statistics are not suited to modern data science because it is not equipped to handle dynamic data, however there is significant nuance to this also.

I'd suggest a bit of a return to the statistics books, but I'd recommend not reading books that just teach you how to apply statistics - as they could just be teaching you recipes that can be used out of context.  I'd suggest a deeper dive into more fundamental books on the derivation of statistical tests.  Only once this has been done can you return to the recipe books and know when they apply and their limitations.

After reading that, your conclusion will likely be that all statistical tests are based on models and assumptions that attempt to replicate some relevant aspect of reality - but that they never are reality itself and all results must be taken with a pinch of salt (noting assumptions etc).",2,1740540511.0

Do you have the same kind of people accessing your website at 6pm on a Tuesday as 10am on a Saturday? What about repeat visitors? Is someone still on your sample on their second visit?

If you expect a specific result and are not seeing it, or even finding trends that may seem bizarre. Even if things look appropriate at least testing a couple random sample selections will reinforce any findings that your testing uncovers. Being thorough is better than being inaccurate. Even if you split an appropriate sample size into a multiple sample evaluation. Its not just the testing but the details of the test that can impact the results.

When dealing with large data your sample size is important if it is far too small it has a much bigger impact on the reflection of your findings and their significance. If multiple samples are not able to be performed ask yourself if you were at a concert with hundreds of thousands of people how easy would it be to select a significantly not proportionate sample of people who are attending to see a specific band out of a large band list. Statistically you may grab a lot of the main headliner band fans, but multi-sampling or even using new metrics to confirm the results that you are finding. But at the end of the day too small of a sample can easily bring inaccurate information amongst big data datasets.

However, I created a neural network architecture that adheres to current neural network models and really examines an aspect that in Big Data and noisy data specifically that is currently overlooked. It compares feature relationships and discovers complex feature relationships which in turn provides another metric to consider especially with large feature datasets in which you may run into issues like you have talked about and it could help confirm importance of your statistical findings or show possible discrepancies in initial findings.

You are correct, sample size was a problem in the past. But the statistical tools built in the past, were built in a way that they usually converge to same as calculating for population as your sample size grows. Your 30 people is a good example, the T-distribution (which I think where you got this example from),[ converges to standard normal distribution as sample size grows](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2246154/show-t-distribution-is-close-to-normal-distribution-when-df-is-large).

>""Stakeholders have complained that it's very hard to reach statistical significance using the popular A/B Testing tools, like Optimizely and have tasked me with building a A/B Testing tool from scratch.""

You need to be VERY cautious with these statements. If there is no stat sig (under your test design assumptions), then it means that this change didn't drive the desired business KPI, and that's it, no discussion. We cannot ""force"" something to have stat sig, just because we want to. Want can be checked, though, is the MDE (minimum detectable effect) of your test design. Did your test design considered a reasonable MDE? Maybe that's what your stakeholders need, the impact of the change is so marginal that it would be necessary to create a test design with a more suitable MDE.

>  
To start with the most basic possible approach, I started by running a z-test to compare the conversion rates of the variations and found that, using that approach, you can reach a statistically significant p-value with about 100 visitors. Results are about the same with chi-squared and t-tests, and you can usually get a pretty great effect size, too.

  
Again, statistical significance here is under the rules of your a test design (MDE, critical value, power etc.). You can get stat sig for a 100 people for a given MDE with a give type-I and type-II error rates. It seems to me that this is not so clear to you.

meizrkn,1ix350m,snivvygreasy,"Competition Demystified.


Hands down. 


Most business books make strategy sound like an elite sport—complex, full of buzzwords, and meant for CEOs in boardrooms. Competition Demystified does the exact opposite. It takes one of the most misunderstood topics in business—why some companies win and others don’t—and breaks it down so that anyone can get it.


This book will completely change how you look at businesses, whether it’s a global giant like Walmart or your local coffee shop. You’ll start noticing why some companies thrive while others struggle, why certain businesses seem to have no real competition, and why being the first or the biggest doesn’t always mean success.


It’s not just for business owners or investors—if you’ve ever wondered why Myspace died but Facebook took over, or why some brands can charge double and people still buy, this book explains it all. And the best part? No complicated theories, just straight-up common sense backed by real examples.

FANATICAL PROSPECTING!

Seriously, I got into startups/my first marketing agency role at 2016 through picking up different free certs online and reading a ton of business books. 

This is one of the later ones I read after that initial burst of reading but sweet christ I don't recommend any other book on business. 

It breaks things down a good bit, as well he kinda tells you things opposite of what you think some pushy sales person might push on you and i really came away loving the book because of that. 

Like in one part he talks about going through rejection as a sales person and where I feel like a lot tell u to push through it and hustle anyways he says there's basically no way you won't feel like shit or that you aren't and has a really great passage in that moment. Feels very anti Gary V/the don't be a bitch mentality and I loved that.

But the costs are totally different from software/streaming.

A lot of gyms are getting into medspa services, even glp-1 shots where they make$100 in profit per shot (given weekly). That’s very different economics than a gym that you pay for but never use.

meevype,1iwemoj,yellowflexyflyer,"I might be somewhat qualified to answer this question. I do a bit of due diligence on gyms. 

There are two themes I see. How do we pick the right sites as it is a large capital investment and how do we price correctly. 

For site selection lots of geographic analysis coupled with statistical models goes into this. Basically you’ll be doing things like creating trade areas, cell phone visit patterns (think placer.ai), and tying the cell phones to demographics. From there you regress trade area visit counts + gym characteristics + local competitors against revenue to get a sense for what makes a good site. You can then use that to identify if proposed sites are anticipated to perform well. R-square is probably in the 0.3-0.4 range. 

Some other questions that come up. What do increases/decreases in competitive intensity (I.e., other gyms) mean for gym revenue? You can track competitor gym openings over time to understand when competitors entered and perform event studies on revenue. 

From there you want to price the ADAs (development areas for franchisees). What is the potential of an ada based on your geospatial model and how should it be priced?

The next big question is how local demographics impact membership sales. Especially the more expensive memberships. For example, if you are planet fitness you want to locate in areas with more women (among other traits) as they are more likely to buy black card memberships. Once you have that down you might look at membership pricing architecture to understand how you should price and what services you should offer at each level. 

Then you are looking at member churn. What can you identify from a member churn perspective. 

Finally you might look at services offered versus competitors. Perform some social listening to understand and distill sentiment. Identify how you can accelerate new gym maturity curves to accelerate the payback period. Etc.

Probably lots of other work to be done top of funnel on the marketing side as well, but I’m typically focused on the pieces mentioned above.

In haven’t seen much on preventative maintenance. Most larger chains know their equipment replacement cycles pretty well so that isn’t a big deal.

In Europe, we have a pretty big chain called ""Basic Fit"". They operate in the Benelux, France, Spain, Germany and Portugal. To enter in a gym, you have to scan a QR code with your phone. Each gym uses a lot of smart cameras. 

They also use a lot of screens per gym displaying ads, advices and recipes + some important international news. 

Overall, they collect basic personal informations, gym attendance, some bio metrics if you use the connected weight scales and have a video feed of the gyms interiors. They also have the classical financial datas and equipments. Finally they add supplementary informations concerning the surrounding city and population. 


[Applied Data Science in Basic Fit]

I know (team member worked for them in Eindhoven) that basic fit employs several data scientists to identify suitable gym locations, predict maintenance cost, user attendance, peak time and user lifetime value as well as monitor the models.


[Conclusion]

So your main intuition is right and in line with the sector. Still, they could probably use some fancy models, maybe using the smart cameras, to predict machines usage and optimal numbers in order to reduce the waiting time during peak hours (coming from a member).

Once you get a sample of a few thousand prospects (or current members depending on the scope), you can use Hierarchical Bayes to produce attribute level utility scores for every single respondent.

mf06vl6,1iwu845,Intelligent_Teacher4,"Hello DataScience,

I started my journey into Data Science approximately August of 2023. I devoted myself to a concentrated study path, mentored by a Data Science specialist friend, of bootcamps and certification courses devoting 12-16 hours a day 7 days a week. I developed skills in python programming, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, advanced mathematics, cloud systems, AI automation, SQL, and much more. I focused a lot of my energy on the functional skills involved with Data Science with course work guided by my mentor. The same style of learning and knowledge focused as my previous career as a Paramedic in which I maintained for 14 years until a near fatal accident.

I was given a job opportunity April of 2024 as a Data Science Project Manager with the company Kmbara. I have been successful in my position and continued my learning journey through Data Engineer Academy, and courses including Multicloud, DevOps, and AI bootcamps. Slowly developing my skills and education. I have converted our management system from Waterfall to AGILE in the first week of working. I have managed technical review contracts, a bi-weekly cadence with AGILE, task management, client to developer communications, system designs, and even some training on unknown systems. These are just a small list of the duties that I have maintained and had to educate myself on along the way.

The past year, I have spent approximately 8 months combining my knowledge of neuroscience from my paramedic background with my newly acquired data science knowledge, I developed a novel neural network architecture that can be adapted to any current neural network architecture enhancing it, and benchmark testing has shown an improvement in accuracy and outcome of these current models. Further testing has shown the design I have named ""The Logic Band"" to perform as predicted by design. This outcome has me excited due to the predicted real-world applications, and may the first step in adding a dimensional avenue of growth to the current linear growth potential of Artificial Intelligence.

I currently have a 16 page full paper on my design and research including adaptions to several different types of neural networks involving regression and classification, computer vision, and even natural language processing models. I also have a formatted 6 page submission paper ready for conferences this year. I am excited to release this design into open source and would really like to know if there are any suggestions to submit my paper to for visibility so everyone can start learning about ""The Logic Band"" and maybe even further developing it for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence all together.

Thanks for your time. All suggestions and opinions welcomed, please and thank you all!

I have a PhD and 14 years of experience in environmental science and because of uncertainty in my current position with the US federal government I'm looking for the next step in my career. I'm considering something like a certificate or master's in data science to expand my marketability. I'm starting nearly from scratch - for example, I have limited experience with R and don't know Python at all - but I'm comfortable with programming-adjacent things like advanced Excel functions and Power Automate. I have a couple questions for you: 
- Is days science a good addition to my resume? Or are there related fields that I should consider to parlay my PhD and experience?
- The extra time and expense of a master's gives me pause, but I wonder if higher salaries with the master's would outweigh those. Any advice on one or the other?

mfarrlj,1iwu845,woolgatheringfool,"Hello, I'm a data analyst and part-time grad student trying break into DS. I'm not quite there yet but learning a lot and shoring up some foundational weaknesses in math and stats which I didn't really take in college. In my program, I'm doing well though probably not elite. I understand the concepts broadly and can usually get to deeper understandings with sufficient time. I have scripting/programming experience and I'm quite proficient with SQL, but I've never completed any large-scale project or deployed models or anything like that. I am worried that even after I complete my MS I will still be unqualified for the DS jobs that I'm seeing, even ""entry-level"" ones. My current job doesn't have much room for growth or expansion. It's mostly QA with SQL queries.

I have two questions. Has anyone been in a similar situation and landed a role like Jr DS where you were guided along for the first year or so by competent seniors? If so, what was that experience like? Where are you now in your career, and where do you think you would be without that opportunity?

Second, do real Jr DS roles exist anymore? If so, how do you find them? If not, are my only options to get experience internships, personal projects, or pushing for more responsibility/special projects at work? That last one feels obvious, but I work in an extremely silo'ed company where teams do one thing and don't interact. It's possible to land some project but very difficult.",1,1740769214.0

If a skill didn’t contribute to something you‘ve done, it has no business being on your resume. So it’s either redundant or unnecessary.  

And use bullets. Do not have a long paragraph that makes it hard for others to find specific points later. Also, don’t just say, “I did this thing.” What was the impact? How well did you do it? “Built a model using these tools that was this accurate and resulted in this many new customers!” Action-impact. You led a neural networks research team?

4. The academic background...a B.A. or B.S? summa cum laude? add those details
5. the skils, in the stupid column. make each of them hyperlinks to specific githup projects where you showcase your direct, observable, experience. If you don't it makes you sound like you're just spamming accolades for keyword algos. consider embedding the keywords into your refined, bulleted, job descriptions.

# 1️⃣ Terrible Readability: Poor Formatting Kills First Impressions

🔴 **Issue:** The **layout is messy and not visually engaging**. The **long blocks of text** in the experience section are hard to scan. Recruiters **only spend 6–10 seconds** skimming a resume—if it’s too dense, they’ll skip it.  
✅ **Fix:**

* **Use a two-column layout with better spacing** (left: skills, education, contact | right: experience).
* **Bullet points should be short & to the point**, max **2 lines each**.
* **Use bold text to highlight key achievements** instead of making everything look the same.

# 2️⃣ About Me Section is Useless (Recruiters Don’t Care!)

🔴 **Issue:** The **""About Me"" section is generic fluff** and **wastes valuable space**. Recruiters already know you want to extract insights from data.  
✅ **Fix:**  
❌ Remove this completely.  
✔️ Instead, use **a 2–3 sentence summary** that **shows impact**:

me401b7,1iv8cbv,MaceGrim,"Technically, it’s nothing new. The techniques you’re mentioning: distillation, reinforcement learning, and mixtures of experts have been at NeurIPS in various forms since at least 2023. I’m afk atm so I don’t have links, but google those terms and you should be able to find them.

Every LLM that you talk to naturally has been fine-tuned using human evaluated datasets on LLM outputs using reinforcement learning to mimic the human preferences. This is what we generally call reinforcement learning from human feedback. It fine tunes the model to be more conversational and is also where a lot of the safety mechanisms come in.

Distillation is relevant because you can train LLMs much faster with good data, and what data is better to use than the question/answer pairs from a model with billions of dollars behind it? You or I can’t do this because OpenAI would squash us pretty hard, but a Chinese company working in secret could.

The “combination” of models you might be referring to as the mixture of experts, and that’s not necessary true. A mixture of expert model replaces its feed forward layers with a set of (much) smaller dense feed forward layers and then a routing layer that chooses which of them to use given the input. This allows the model to run with far fewer calculations because it doesn’t need to activate the GIANT feed forward layers, just a subset of its experts. This is a big reason why DeepSeek can serve the model so much more cheaply than others.

Edit:

As for synthetic data, if you're able to generate data that are similar to your use case they can be useful for finetuning a smaller model (labelling your own data will *probably* be better, relatively more expensive). 

 For use cases like NER, LLMs does produce coherent sentences (though biased - over representing some tokens e.g. delves) which may be useful in teaching language structures which can assist in NER.

They quite literally described the whole process in paper, if you are talking about reasoning model.


1. They tried their RL method upon top of the base model. V3->R1-Zero. That was not bad, but chains of thoughts were often non-comprehensible.
2. To avoid that - they finetuned the model with SFT before RL. Here we ends up with R1 (V3->some SFT finetune->R1).
3. They also tried to reproduce this RL approach on smaller models. While it gave some success - it was less succesfull than distillation from their big model.

Pretty much the only major one that I don't have much experience with is SAS, but I'm sure I could learn it if I ever needed to.

With that said, my take-away is that the best statistical software tool is the one that your colleagues/collaborators use. End of story. In 2025, Python is the most versatile and can do a wider range of things than other tools, so that's the best one right now to learn if you're starting from scratch. But you sometimes need to be flexible. I wouldn't choose to every use SPSS again, but if that's what a co-author used and we just needed to do basic descriptive analyses, then I'd figure it out and deal with its limitations. And be aware that at some point in the next decade or two something better than Python will come along and you'll need to learn something new.

There are two ways to avoid these cognitive biases so that this type of statements would not even arise. One is to be exposed to a broad set of analytical applications (i.e. different unrelated industries, including academia and government). The other is by studying the history of the fields that eventually converged or contributed to create data science as we know it today.

As others have pointed out, try using Python with things like mixed models, hierarchical models, GLM, GEE, Bayesian statistics, GAMs, survival models, ordinal and other semi-parametric models, inferential statistics, sample size and power calculations, and you would replace R with Python in the OP statement in no time.

The fact that a lot of people in data science aren't exposed to these methods don't make them less important or less applicable, but rather points to availability bias.

LLMs are fundamentally a tool for generating language. Many many problems require minimal or no language to solve. There are so many possible approaches to these problems that haven't yet been tapped.

A few years ago the hype was around AlphaGo and their other game-playing AIs for example. Those had very little to do with LLMs, but it's a very interesting problem space with a lot to teach us.

Generating language is a fairly expensive operation for businesses, so it's a potentially profitable endeavour for companies to create and sell those models. That's why we're seeing so much hype, because it's finally a saleable product instead of a toy.

What do you think “development” is? Lmao, it’s *always* been API calls and engineering.

Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft own the stack, everyone else just rents it. This isn’t decentralizing intelligence it’s centralizing control.

You don’t need to build a foundation model to add value. There’s a *ton* of potential value in the whole stack. See cursor, character.ai, or perplexity as widespread examples. Not to mention all the places it’s being deployed commercially. And if your problem really is with the foundational models, open source (DeepSeek, llama) come really close to SOTA.

Keep in mind that word/sentence vectorizing uses semantics so you might get weird results if you go on name alone.

Second, give at least some files descriptive names. Go up to a sentence if you need to in order to get the details of what it is. If it's not in production or referenced by anything then having a long name does not matter and just makes keyword search easier.

Finally, have a word doc or something where you document all your projects. You can write a paragraph, do a bulleted list of key things like models run, functions created, whatever helps you organize relevant information for future use. Again, think about how you remember things or what you look for to find a project and make descriptions that are useful to that goal. If you want something a little more fancy you can use something like Obsidian. Personally I like to organize by project folder and will document the contents of the folder in a single note.

It is going to suck to make this document. You will not want to update it, you will feel like it's a waste of time, you will feel like you'll remember that really important thing later, do it anyway.

The data science and GenAI field is exploding. It’s been called the sexiest job of the 21st century.

And yet, many data scientists seem to be leaving the field in droves. Job satisfaction is low, and burnout is high. There are many reasons for this.

When interviewing for potential data science roles, candidates are told the company has “mountains of data” and “endless exciting problems to tackle”. This is often not true.

Companies have immature tech stacks, make data cleaning and productionizing models a nightmare.

Company culture is not data-driven, causing data scientists to struggle to get buy-in for their work.

Data scientists are often siloed in their work, and don’t get to work on the most interesting problems.

Data Compass’s mission is to make organizations’ data maturity levels (be they large corporations, startups, non-profits, or government agencies) transparent to data job seekers and the data community.

This tool lets you create (from scratch) or tailor your resume from (e.g., for a specific job posting) using mixture of Cursor & ChatGPT-like interface. The resumes it generates follow best practices and are ATS-optimized. 

The whole experience is meant to resemble resume writing consultant – when you first dump your resume into the tool, it already suggests first things that you can do to improve. On the other hand, if you want to tweak it for a particular job position (as in this video), the tool will ask some additional questions to get better understanding of your experience OR just tweak it automatically based on all the info that the tool already has (e.g. from current resume or from past conversations).

I think there's space between telling your ds team to create a notebook to automate some rules based on a marketers intuition immediately and letting them build the best sales model ever for 3 years and getting a -.005% return. What I think is being lost is the ability to artisinally craft solutions that fit the specific scenario. Not being forced to standardize everything into oblivion until inexpensive, commoditized employees can run it with little training. Not buying whatever softwares being peddled and being told to make it work when there's not enough flexibility to get the job done.

I don't know, I'm not saying that things were ever this way so it may not technically be being ""lost"" but I've got an ideal in my head where data scientists are held accountable for business outcomes (including short term roi) and allowed to have freedom and innovation in their solutions. Less automating and standardizing, more organic science, testing, observation and experimentation 

I read a book called the innovators hypothesis and it aligned with what I think it should be like.

In my own work, I do both. There are parts of our work where having more rigorous data science makes sense because the current methods don't help us to make good decisions and we kind of ignore that because what we are doing is ""good enough"", when we are just kidding ourselves that we're doing anything more than sticking our fingers in the air to figure out the direction of the wind. If you have a lot of money on the line then that's not good enough.

On the other hand, we also waste a lot of money by thinking that we need to be more rigorous when there are ""$200"" solutions that would get the job done. Sometimes a toilet is broken and it just needs fixing, as you say.

Data science is not an academic or real ""science"", it is more of a newfangled word of salespeople and managers than it is a reality, because of this there is a lot of confusion and expectations, and it has never been romantic, unless you work, for example, as a researcher in scientific or research centers, where experiments are really needed. Data science probably includes many professions, for example, a business analyst or an engineer, which in turn puts in the first place not romance, but the main rule of an engineer - you need to solve the problem. Returning to the analogy with the toilet, I would describe it this way: a plumber analyzes how much time he needs to do it as quickly as possible to get the final result for an adequate price, but at the same time so that the toilet does not fall apart in 5 minutes - this is probably a utopia of perfection, but it at least sets the bar for how it should be done, and this is probably the everyday life of any engineer - and if research is needed, then it is probably more for scientists or maybe quants. I think the main problem has become overestimating expectations and being too customer-oriented, for example with the toilet - now the customer tells you where to put the tank and what it's called or what pipes to change (I'll tell you about this currently popular LLM, where they push it where they don't want it and you don't have the right to call things by their own names - because then you won't have customers and you'll have to listen to how to turn the tank upside down 500 times) and now data scientists are called AI engineers, which used to be called ML and even earlier data scientists.",1,1739908307.0

Along what you were thinking, you can also use techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and confidence intervals to predict trends, assess risks, and measure the impact of strategic changes. The goal of these efforts is more efficient operations and better strategic planning. For example: should a business open a new location at a location given its proximity of existing locations, competitors, and customers? That sort of thing.

I’m looking to transition into data science but could really use some guidance from those who’ve been through a similar journey. Here’s a bit about my situation:

* **Background:** I don’t have a degree in any STEM field (my background is completely unrelated), but I’m currently self-studying Python with a focus on data science-related topics (e.g., pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.).
* **Constraints:** I’m beyond the age where I can study full-time, as I have to work to support myself. This means I need to balance learning with a full-time job.
* **Goal:** I want to build the skills necessary to land an entry-level role in data science or a related field (e.g., data analysis).

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar transition, especially those without a traditional STEM background. Here are some specific questions I have:

1. **Learning Path:** What topics or tools should I prioritize after Python? Should I dive into SQL, machine learning, or something else?
2. **Portfolio:** What kinds of projects should I work on to build a strong portfolio that showcases my skills to potential employers?
3. **Networking:** How did you network or find opportunities without a traditional academic background?
4. **Job Search:** What entry-level roles should I target initially? Are there specific industries or companies that are more open to self-taught candidates?
5. **Time Management:** Any tips for balancing self-study with a full-time job? How long did it take you to feel job-ready?

I chose the informal education route and was under the impression that if I can showcase my skills in the projects I do in my github, I'd have an edge against masters graduates. So, I've read dozens of books about DS and ML and did several projects. I tried to read at least 2-3 books on each subject and combine all that info to build a strong portfolio. But now I feel like they don't even look at github and to be honest I don't even know what they want in applicants.

I was planning on enrolling in a 1 year program in the US as an international student as a last resort but the market is pretty bad there for data scientists (I've read most of the threads about DS job market). Interviews have gotten longer and harder and generalist data science grads are at a disadvantage apparently. The university I was planning on applying has a data engineering concentration in addition to data science courses that allows you to take 3 courses about data engineering, so it's a good program.

Masters in DS in EU isn't possible as all the decent universities there want a computer science undergrad education. Also, Trump made or is likely to make hiring OPT and H1B holders harder for employers (like he did before) by making paperwork more expensive, making us more expensive to hire, and through other means.

So, I'm really not sure whether to give a career in data science another shot one more year by learning more, doing more projects, contacting recruiters and other good practices recommended in youtube videos instead of blindly applying to jobs. I can also wait about a year while learning more and doing projects and see how Trump administration will go about us international students and then maybe enroll in a 1 year long program with tons more knowledge and a stronger github profile which will increase my chances of landing a job there.

My other option is to simply give up on data science and enroll in a robotics masters in the EU.

I am actively looking to get into a data science role, and am excited, but also quite stressed to do so!

I have a First class Computing degree (in which I got 90% in a data mining module in my final year) and also have one year's experience in IT operations as part of a placement in my degree. I pursued teaching straight after university and this is my 4th year now including the year training. My degree is 4 years old now (which I am stressed about!!).

I am working on the IBM data science course in coursera, reading and learning from intro to statistical learning and taking two more courses on statistics and linear algebra on coursera. I've done 3 out of the 12 modules fdor the IBM course and am working my way through the other ones + the stats book. My maths foundation is pretty strong and I can grasp all the concepts relatively easily. I also can code in Python (although need to learn pandas and how to generally code as a data scientist, which won't take long), and am learning R. I know SQL as well and am able to confidently build relational databases and use statements to query them.

What I don't have is any personal projects to show my abilities. That is what I am working towards once I finish these courses (at least that is the plan). I am planning to hopefully finish my learning and get one project done by June, considering I spend 3 hours on weekdays and 5-6 hours on weekends working on this. I wanted to maybe pursue a masters degree in ML and DS online, but its 2 years and obviously will have to pay for it. I don't really want to spend another 2 years teaching!

Can anyone shed some light on whether this is doable for me, and if this is even a good way of going about things? Should I be using any other resources? And how hard will it be getting a job in the field considering my degree is now 4 yrs old and I didn't go into industry?

Those of us who have been working in this area for a while know that it’s gone from “what do you do?” To “is this magic?” To “is this accounting?” Over the last 15 years. 

Looking at some of these posts, you can see that a lot of people don’t understand that they are in a business, and the goal of business is to make money. There are many projects that just don’t need to be groundbreaking scientific studies. You need a regression and you’re done. Giving your shareholders something that they have no clue what they are looking at is a waste of time. You can’t operate as a black box for long. Most of these projects are just some form alternative form of p-hacking or overfitting masquerading as progress. 

The days of ***”Trust Me, I’m Right!”*** are over. This is what happens when an industry matures. 

You need to learn how to get good enough answers that don’t break the bank. Every hour my people spend on a project costs about $90. More if my leads have to spend a lot of time checking it for problems. 

I am going to have a hard time justifying my department if every time a c-suite wants to know if the price of eggs is going up or down, my department spends 85 hours L1 coding an answer, my leads spend 10 hours reviewing the data, I spend 3 hours verifying we want to send it, that’s a $9,000 - $10,000 question that gets you the answer eggs are $7.54/dozen this week and should be $7.58/dozen next week vs a quick and dirty answer that says it’s $7.52 this week and $7.56 next week. That’s a $45-90 answer. We also don’t know how much more accurate the answer is. Your stakeholders have no clue what the accuracy of this new thing is or what it means. They at best, kinda grasp how accurate a regression is. 

Very few of your projects are going to be worth the effort you put into them, especially if you are doing a lot of ad hoc work. Business leaders have noticed how many projects have negative ROI. 

Your teams have to justify your value, and to be honest, most people in data are not good at it. 

The more often you have a project that you explain to a supervisor that you spent $10,000 on a project, you are painting a target on the department. Our salaries also don’t help us any. 

In the eyes of someone seeing a project as $100/hour X 100 hours = $10,000 the simplest thing to make it cheaper is 100 hours X $25/hour = $2,500.

The MSDS is super helpful in a general, non-programming setting, especially if you already have some domain knowledge. You can set up experiments to prove or disprove anyone's hypotheses. You understand how certain ""trends"" might be misleading. You can make effective visuals to show to board members and so on.

- Majority of them can’t communicate at all. Ask them why a model’s results aren’t being used. They’ll start by saying model’s test scores are good so it’s users lack of scientific understanding. They don’t even try to understand the lack of traction from the user POV. For users a DS product is usually a 10/20% focus area and should be a tool like a calculator - should be reliable and if not then replaced or fixed. It’s wasteful for users to come up with root cause analysis.

mcx3p14,1iq0gwj,genobobeno_va,"First, data science always had to prove that it had a soul. STEM, Stats, and CS people have argued about the axioms of DS for about 15 years… and whether DS even has a definition. I think of it mostly as an applied science, so in a way, DS feels a lot like “engineering for inference” (just riffing here). Thus why, to me, DS has to have a mix of CS folks, Stats folks, Physics folks, and Storytellers.

I think a lot of execs have convinced themselves, over the last 15 years of heavier and heavier usage of data, that they are data experts. So now those “decision makers” demand a higher frequency of substandard metrics. In every organization that I’ve ever worked, the requests have slowly become more and more slicey-dicey (zoom in, overlay, add 3 more columns, plot 4 dimensions, Gini & ROC & KS & AUC … etc etc), and so laypeople are definitely “observing” more analytics even tho they don’t necessarily have a clue about the assumptions of the analyses, nor how we bake the cake. Worse, BI/BA folks will happily follow the orders to smash together a Tableau or Power BI dashboard, and now these execs come to believe that they’re just as skilled as the data scientists.

This, to me, is just the classical trend of American immediacy… and we’re also approaching the peak of the current economic bubble, driven by the greatest “crap in, crap out” generator ever created: the GLLMM. And tbh, it is legendary technology. I use it everyday and it’s far far more efficient for problem solving than interacting with any human or search engine at my disposal. And it does create a very useful middle layer of communication between contexts. But of course, it’s unwieldy & costly for thin, well-defined, quantitative use cases like classifiers or rank-ordering… but the execs don’t know that. They’ve felt its magic and they think that magic is a skeleton key for every hidden treasure of value and efficiency that they can squeeze from the business. 

And “squeeze” is my favorite metaphorical verb for the financial fascism of the current state of the massive American economic machine. Crypto/Stonks/Currency wars/semiconductors/Hyperscalers/Elon/SV/Daytrading-QQQ… We’re just gonna have to wait for the central protagonists (the finance folks) to fall out of favor after the insane leverage in the system finally leaks out of the significantly overvalued markets.

And they thought that 'data science' would bring them that. Or they just lied their stockholders about that, I don't know. The problem is that, of course, 'data science' can't function in this kind of environment. And also, there are just a few firms that actually need something sophisticated and you can't hire all the people in this sector, considering the explosion in their number (because of hype) in those few firms. Most smaller companies actually need warehousing/SQL analytics and they don't even use them at their real potential. And let's be honest, all that most DS practitioners seem to do and talk about is in the model.fit()/model.predict() paradigm. Real world never works like that, you can't treat every source of data as a kind of generic data frame on which you run various functions from sklearn. Any autoML commercial pipeline would eliminate the need for this kind of 'data science' teams. This won't bring you far anyway and the businesses have realized they don't benefit financially from this superficial approach. But on their part, they are also not serious about making the necessary changes in their organization/business strategies to use data science at its full potential. Data science today and every data related job seem like a bulshit job. It is amazing how fast the hypes are born and die these days.

Wake up 5:15AM - Get ready for workout, then fuck around online for like 45ish minutes. Been into looking at interior design stuff lately since that’s becoming a hobby of mine.

6:15 AM-7:15AM - Workout at home - I’m really into yoga lately so been doing that.

7:15AM-7:45AM - Shower, get ready (ie put on sweatpants + rotation of 3 baggy t-shirts + hair in ponytail - no bra is one of the many liberations WFH offers me), make bed. 

7:45AM-9:00AM - If work is not too busy I use this time on a course or some kind of independent learning on a topic I’m interested in (I’ve done git deep dive, DBT/Snowflake, time series, a couple Bayesian stats courses, hoping to get into something elasticity modelling related next). If work is feeling busy or I’m feeling behind though I’ll use this time to get work done.

9:00AM-12:00PM - Work in quiet bliss. I’m on eastern time but a lot of my company is on pacific time, so i always get this time for heads down work/meeting-free which I love.

12:00PM-5:00PM - Work but 3/5 days per week I’ll have several meetings. So usually lighter tasks here that are easier to context switch from. If my partner is working from home she brings me lunch to my desk. If not I’ll pull together some apple, cheese, turkey pepperoni, crackers and hummus and call that a lunch. I really should take more breaks but it’s hard to when I’m focused on something.

5:00PM - 5:30PM - If I’m feeling generous or if a meeting is a struggle to schedule otherwise I’ll sometimes stay online but usually I’m out.

5:30PM - onwards - Work no longer exists and I ignore those people. Unless weather is bad (in Toronto so it can get a bit too cold like 20-30 days per year) will try to leave my apartment, go for a walk at least, do something with partner or friends. I’ve been taking painting classes as well once per week.

I usually get into bed around 9 fall asleep by 10-10:30, but occasionally if plans run late I’ll be asleep by 11 (usually 1-2 times per week).

Put another way, the business side has no appreciation for the business data model, which leads to misunderstandings about best solutions for its own organization.

The response sounds a lot like typical management-speak, nicely formatted with bullet points and some buzz words. Perhaps that's why some managers like it:

This statement highlights some valid concerns about the mismanagement of AI implementation in industries. Here are a few points to consider:

# Agree:

1. **Lack of Understanding**: Managers without a strong grasp of AI may be swayed by the hype, making decisions based on trends rather than informed insights.
2. **Cost-Cutting Measures**: Cutting salaries and pushing impossible deadlines can lead to burnout and talent loss, as skilled workers seek better opportunities elsewhere.
3. **Subpar AI Implementation**: Rushing to replace skilled workers with AI that isn't fully functional can lead to inefficiencies, lower quality products, and increased technical debt.
4. **Investor Pressure**: The focus on short-term gains for investors can drive a race to the bottom, compromising long-term sustainability and industry standards.

# Disagree:

1. **AI's Potential**: Properly implemented AI can enhance efficiency, productivity, and innovation in IT and other fields.
2. **Educational Initiatives**: Increasing education and awareness about AI among managers can mitigate the risks associated with poor decision-making.
3. **Balanced Approach**: When combined with skilled human workers, AI can augment capabilities rather than replace them, leading to better outcomes.

Ultimately, the key lies in responsible AI adoption. This means ensuring that those in decision-making positions are well-informed, that there is a balanced approach to integrating AI with human expertise, and that the focus remains on long-term benefits rather than short-term gains.

To address your question: Outside of a few use cases (e.g. improving chatbots, etc) they seem to require a lot of babysitting to make sure that you’ve pigeonholed them into your problem space in such a way that their behavior is right (I.e. performance is good). Add on to that they’re hard to debug and as a data person I come away feeling: these are really fascinating feats of engineering, but the level of effort I have to put in to trust/verify their output makes them probably not a great fit. *In other words, for a lot of problems they’re too complex and uninterpretable as models to justify their use, at least until you’ve exhausted other simpler options (e.g. understanding your problem space enough to just use plain old regression, basic classification methods, etc).*

Maybe it’s curmudgeonly of me, but I truly feel the LLM hype is a wave that will pass. It’ll find great success in a few niche areas and become industry standard there. But it’s not some panacea for data science in industry at large, at least not for production use cases (use of AI for personal tooling is a whole different ballgame that I’m more bullish on).

I like to keep it simple: focus on the basics, because there is a TON of interesting business problems out there that are solvable though classic data science methods (e.g. regression models). Plus, if you play your cards right you can hype your work as being “powered by AI” while saving the company money by not blowing cash on subscriptions to the major LLM-monetizing companies (or even worse trying to train one yourself — those are deep waters with questionable economics for most businesses).

[https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ag-news](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ag-news)  
Here is a dataset they used. You could run an experiment to see how R1 performs on the task they used in the paper. 

Their are published benchmarks that companies look to as the north star for performance. Benchmarks aren't perfect but they are a good starting point to understand general performance. When I am developing a key feature, I often test a few models on that specific task. It's still tricky to know due to inherent subjectivity of most tasks. The real test is always how it performs in production with different users giving different inputs at scale and how satisfied they are with the output.

For a reasoning model the most cut and dry thing to test on is actually a coding task. It takes real reasoning and the whether it failed or not is more cut and try. Look at the SWE

I would go to your boss with the published benchmarks and ask: ""Is there something specific you would want to test R1's capabilities with?"" Evaluating LLM's is a tricky business, but more importantly, you are solving a problem others already have with benchmarks. Try and get some scope on the project. Other wise just stay busy and keep your boss happy! Overall, classifications tasks may not be the best test.

What you need is LLM as the judge.

mcl9neu,1imkowl,t0rtois3,"My understanding is that LLMs do not reason. What they do is repeatedly choose the word most likely to come next based on  
a)what they have seen in their training material  
b)whatever previous words(usually the prompt) were given to them  
c)whatever previous words they have produced  
until a ""end of response"" token has been predicted.

I've spent a significant part of the last 6 months struggling with LLMs and classifications. Here's a few things I've had some success with.

\-Classify one item per prompt if possible to avoid influence from each item on the classification of the others.   
  
\-If the LLM is hallucinating up new categories, request that it repeat the categories given before giving the answer. This puts the list of categories among the closest words to the answer and increases their influence on the final category given.  
  
\-Ask it to rate its own categorisation and you can then filter out categorisations which have low ratings. Sometimes the categorisation of an item can be debatable, or may vary depending on the categories and/or items available. Is a tomato a vegetable? It depends on the context; functionally(for cooking) yes, but scientifically no. Instead of forcing the LLM into a yes/no without providing context, rating might enable you to score a tomato higher on the vegetable scale than, say, an apple, but lower than spinach.  
  
\-If you have a lot of categories or some very generic categories, limit the number which can be assigned to each item. I had no control over my category list and would frequently receive categories like ""benefit"" which meant that basically anything positive would be shoved under it, overloading the category and making the categorisation meaningless. Setting a category limit on each item helped me prioritise the most relevant categories for assignment to it and skip over generic or marginally-relevant categories. 

\-Lowering the top k or temperature parameters might help you restrict the LLM from choosing categories that are less likely to be correct.

mc3i299,1imf5q9,yaksnowball,"I've been doing a couple of interviews (mid/senior roles 4+ YoE) and have been surprised by the amount of work that some of these take home challenges require. I've gotten to the end of a handful very recently so maybe I can help. I literally have one asking to deploy a full recommendation API (not a toy model, one actually fit to a specific dataset they have provided). Like, are you paying me??

My approach is usually EDA in a notebook to understand if cleaning is needed (string normalization, check for nulls, check for duplicates etc.), understand pre-processing is needed, what features are useful, etc. This is probably the most important step as if you don't notice things like null values, duplicates, badly formatted strings, collinearity (for linear models) or whatever other common pitfall then they certainly won't be impressed by whatever solution you use afterwards. If you can do a proper EDA, in most cases the solution afterwards doesn't really matter (i.e whether you get 80% accuracy with a random forest or 83% with GBT).

From there just a regular pipeline based on what the EDA tells me. It almost always looks like: read data, clean data, transform/encode data, fit model, evaluate model. I'll write a quick [README.md](http://README.md) to document the solution and why I chose to build a model X instead of Y, or encode data with Y instead of Z or evaluate with metric A instead of B etc. and then write something to show the hiring manager how to run the training. If possible, I try to pick a solution that will minimize the time spent writing code to encode/pre-process data e.g Gradient Boosted Trees (since they don't require lots of scaling and special treatment of nulls).

I really don't care about the actual fit, once it's not broken, I think that's actually besides the point - I think what people want to see here is how you approach the problem, if you are diligent in your EDA and if you can write a clean end-to-end model fitting pipeline. I have submitted take home tests with 60% accuracy (multiclass problem, not binary to be fair) and haven't received negative feedback for it, in fact they were very happy that I documented the solution and spent 5 minutes dockerizing the solution for them so that they can run it without having to recreate their venv etc. Just presenting a solution in a way that shows you know how to deploy ML solution at junior level already differentiates you from large swathes of the candidate pool.

There's simply not enough time to do a proper SOTA high-performing model unless they give you the easiest datasets of all time. A proper grid search, testing of different encoding/embedding strategies, fancy k-fold evaluation etc. can all wait until they want to actually pay me to do it. Usually in the interview to discuss the solution they will ask you about potential improvements anyway.

There's many existing tools for employees to keep track of general updates of the company. Email is one of them. 

It could be more a culture problem that people aren't choosing to engage with whatever has been tried. An app that's separate from work logins just seems like you're duplicating userbase and authentication, at best it's going to be messy.

My recommendation would be to gather some requirements first, get clarity about exactly what stated problems trying to be solved are, then find existing solutions and get rough estimates on cost and time to deploy them. Then compare that with the opportunity cost of your time to develop it solo

I see from other comments it's about staff communication out of hours, that's definitely a culture thing.

An org typically has a few different communication channels, email, in person, slack, teams, etc. Orgs typically don't have a good communication strategy about what types of information go where, nor what info is consider high priority or not. You can use an SMS middleware provider and send bulk texts and it'll probably cost the company less over 3 years than it would a few days of your time.

Any of the communication channels listed above could work, but the culture needs to be there to encourage people to check them at certain times when they aren't at work.

If you're in Australia, there's right to disconnect laws, which make it ok for employees to refuse unreasonable contact outside of scheduled hours.

I'm considering taking the CU Boulder Masters program on Coursera. All of that said, I'm concerned about the job market. I know it's bad for tech in general.

I have a bachelors in materials engineering, and some work experience in the same field. However, I would like to change my discipline to Data Science. I came to data science as the conclusion after it was recommended by mutuals in the field. I started an AI/ML bootcamp offered by CalTech CTME on simplilearn, to learn about the field and so far I like it, learning python and Machine learning, and it is something I can see myself enjoying more than my current profession (maybe this is a grass is greener situation but I can't see myself continuing where I am and need a change, and need to shift to something that seems more viable for the foreseeable future)

I am thinking of pursuing a masters in data science in the USA. But i read on here about MSDS programs being nothing more than cashgrabs, and having that association with the degree isn't ideal when the end goal is to secure a job in the field. On top of that I read about tech layoffs and from whoever I talk to in the USA (considered international students) , they say DO NOT COME, the job market is horrible (yet they still stay there). Then i also read that such layoffs in tech are cyclic, but applied roles in other fields are more stable comparatively.  
I want to go somewhere where I can eventually settle. I come from a third world country and settling abroad is also a motivation to pursue a masters that can lead to eventual settlement

also what would be the best course of action to learn more

What would be your advice n what I should do? Is USA a good choice? Any other country i should look into that will allow me to change my field and offer better prospects long term? Thank you",1,1739174723.0

Is it even possible for me to break into this field?

I am a new grad with a bachelor's in Data Science and a minor in Mathematics. Due to being a bonehead during my first two years of college, my GPA tanked *hard* and I had to retake quite a few classes (objectively I should not have finished my degree, but I chose to due to sunk cost and my interest in the field). I ended with a 2.9, which is not good enough for just about any decent graduate programs I can find, not even the ones which are ""notoriously easy to get into"".

mc9vs3x,1ilyfhk,highplainsdrift,"Hey guys I just wanted to hear people's honest takes and opinions on my situation.

Background: Recently graduated with PhD in life sciences which was half spent at the bench and half spent analyzing single-cell data (learned to code and analyze/visualize data in R, Python). Mostly for the sake of my partner, I took a postdoc position so we could live in a better city. In my postdoc I now only do translational research by analyzing transcriptomic data (very similar to PhD but only on the data stuff now). I would say my actual knowledge of math and statistics is very basic. My ability to code in Python and R is probably also very basic as it was all self-taught and focuses very much on using the tools common in my field (I would currently probably struggle with medium level coding challenges and leetcode problems). Unfortunately, as much as I have tried there is minimal room in my current research to try and implement ML. While the job isn't very stressful, it fills up enough of my day that I often find myself inconsistently learning other skills (some weeks are just super busy and then others are more chill). 

Goals: Gain a foothold in the data science world. Ideally landing a DS role but I would also settle for DA or BA to gain exp before eventually landing a DS role. 

Question: 

(1) In the current job market, what are some of the highest impact steps I can take to land that next role?

(2) In the current job market, is there a realistic chance I can land a job in the next 6-12 months with part time (5-15 hr/week) study with no prior experience (at least not one a recruiter or hiring manager is likely to recognize)?

(3) Is it worthwhile for me to quit my job and focus FT on just learning, up-skilling, and applying for jobs? 

Other thoughts:

I'm fairly confident I can pick up a lot of the skills needed, but am drowning in the total amount of things that there is to learn. Some threads on reddit seem to suggest a strong foundation in math and statistics is needed, and I would estimate it'd take me several months to get through books on this. I picked up a book on Python for data scientists, and it's so dense it would also probably take me at least a month to go through it, and even then I'm unsure I'd have actually absorbed much of anything. I've also been working through a DataCamp course to get a ML cert, but am finding that the ""fill in the blank"" approach and their videos are just so easy that I really doubt I'm getting much of anything from it (it is nice, though, as an introduction). **My main concern is that I'm not dedicating enough time and that my current job is eating up too much of my time and therefore actively preventing me from making this transition.**",1,1739316360.0

mcdlvnu,1ilb54i,BigSwingingMick,"This is the real heavy lifting for a data manager. Learning how to manage expectations is a key skill. It sounds like your company doesn’t value data analytics as a whole thing, but expects it to just materialize. 

I would try to figure out how to explain what the process is in terms of other departments. 

If you were talking to financial, you wouldn’t expect them to come up with a model instantly, if you were taking to accounting, simple questions could take days for them to answer. If you were looking for the price of a project done by an engineering team, it might be a while for an accurate answer to come back. 

There also needs to be an understanding of the problem and how accurate a solution needs to be given. If they want a 50% accurate answer, I could probably wing it off the top of my head, want a 75% accurate answer, that’s 30 minutes, want a 90% something, that would take a day, want 99% that’s a week, want 99.9% that’s a year. At some point you and the stakeholders need to understand the problem, and how much effort needs to be made to get the most efficient solution. Both of you need to understand the diminishing returns that may or may not be needed. 

They may be asking for a back of envelope answer to a question that you are answering with a thesis. 

My job as a manager is to make sure that other departments understand what they are asking for and that we stay within budget. 

Right now my guys are doing a lot work that our board is pushing for that has mostly sideline all other ad hoc projects. I had to explain that if we do this work, I’m going to have to put ~20 people on this project and I made them show buy-in on the massive amount of work that they want. 

If you don’t communicate with them about how much work they are asking for, everything starts to look indifferent from magic. 

There is also some inner conversation that you might want to have, and that is, are you the most efficient person to be doing these tasks?

They don't. 

Management, especially management that only sees the end product from other sources (maybe a trade show, symposium, convention etc.) don't have a true understanding of the depth that is needed to produce useful analytical information and present it in a way that can make sense to the layman. There is a razor thin margin that realizes what is involved but for the most part, the upper management never needed to the a part of the process to grasp what is required. 

To get over this, you have to communicate realistic expectations and ask them if what you are producing is something that can lead to meaningful results (growth in ROI, efficiency, project scope). Otherwise, its not worth doing if it just looks pretty on a Powerpoint while the underlying information is not acted on or doesn't lead to anything meaningful.

**Top management got to become top management by asking for a lot.** They did not get there by taking a measured approach and figuring out what is the most reasonable request they can make. It's probably one of the most eye opening experiences I've had, but it was when a VP told me that her boss' MO was just always to ask for everything expecting to get something, but never wanting to risk asking for too little and getting less than what he could have.

So it's not just about data science, or analysis, or data. They tend to have that same perspective on everything except the things that they need to do. So their work takes time and needs to be accounted for - everyone else needs to do stuff at superhuman speeds.

Have you noticed that they will does ask to see a deck 48 hours before an important meeting? Does it take them 48 hours to review it? Will they even review it? No, they just know that it might be hard for them to fit it into their schedule, so they know to account for that in their planning.

For them. Not for you though.

**Educate.** Every time you get asked how long something will take, break it down into the component pieces - e.g., 1 day to get the data, 1 day to clean the data, 2 days to figure out stuff, 1 day to put it all together. I think the mistake a lot of us do is to try to get it done as fast as possible, and then our stakeholders just figure out that since sometimes we're able to do things faster, that we should *always* be able to do things faster.",1,1739909421.0

In terms of knowing when to retrain, I’d try to productionize your model using an explore/exploit framework. For example, the treatment decision is dictated by your model for 90% of traffic (the exploit cohort), while 5% of traffic is treated indiscriminately (the explore treatment cohort) and treatment is indiscriminately withheld from the remaining 5% of traffic (the explore control cohort). This lets you (a) monitor the outcomes that your model is delivering relative to a “pure treatment” or “pure control” strategy over time, and (b) gives you a fresh set of experimental data with which to train whenever you find that your model’s performance has degraded.",3,1739064872.0

I’m working on deploying an uplift model for a customer retention campaign, but I’m facing challenges due to changing offers every month.

We have random sampling for control and treatment groups from a few months back, but each month brings a new set of 50+ offer combinations. The model is trained on previous month’s labels, so it learns uplift based on past treatments, which might not fully generalize to the current month’s offers.

A multiple treatment uplift model isn’t feasible due to the high number of offer combinations, so we’re currently treating uplift as a single effect rather than differentiating between specific offers. My main challenges/unsolved questions are:

Generalization Power: Can a standard uplift model generalize well enough across different offers, or are there techniques to improve this assumption?

Model Adaptation: Would online learning or a rolling retraining approach help keep the model aligned with offer changes? Current we will retrain our model every month using the new set of features and label, but it still doesn't perform well.

Validation Strategy: What’s the best way to evaluate if the model remains reliable when past uplift effects are based on different incentives?

To answer your question, yes, it's not going to be 4 explicit rounds/questions of Research Design AND Success Metrics AND Data Analysis AND programming in 45 minutes. Instead, it's going to be one or two SQL questions (for the programming round).

And then,one big question, probably around product metrics, but that'll also touch on Research Design & Data Analytics. Let me give you an example:

>Suppose you were to launch a new product, Facebook Dating. It's similar to Tinder/Hinge. What metrics would you look at, to see if the app is successful?

Here, you'd need to think about the UX/UI of the app, think about WHY Meta is making this app, and what metrics you might have after a month of it being out there in the market. To make it ""Research Design-y"", they could also ask you:

* how would you A/B test this app?
* what are some A/B testing issues you might run into?
* when is it even appropriate to A/B test a feature or not?

Or they may say, ""You launched the app, people seem to like it, but people who use it spend 1% less time on Meta for some reason. Should we launch it?"".

More examples of Product Sense / Product Metrics questions here:

[https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions](https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions)

This is also covered in-depth in Chapter 10 ""Product/Business Sense"" in [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Data-Science-Interview-Questions/dp/0578973839) with 30 real interview questions from companies including Meta.

They'll also be a SQL question or two you'll have to answer. It may or MAY not relate to the product sense question. To practice for SQL, do the Meta tagged questions:

[https://datalemur.com/questions](https://datalemur.com/questions)

But, quite frankly, do all the Medium/Hard SQL questions since there's very little room for error or to be slow because of how competitive the job is and how objective it is to grade SQL performance.

First and foremost, become familiar with the interview environment. They will assess you on CoderPad, without you being able to run code. This part freaks people out usually because they are not used to checking their logic while writing the full solution. You can get flavor of those questions on DI sqlpad, don’t even need to pay or sign up to try sample questions.

Secondly, the 45 minute round is 40 minutes of questions and solutions. Broken down into two parts. Data manipulation using the language of your choice. Pandas, R or SQL depending on what you conveyed with the recruiter. Use the language you are most comfortable with than do drills on that.

The second part is product case into two parts. Usually these product cases are metric focus meaning they are about “how to measure [X] on product [Y]” followed by “how would you improve product [Y]?” Don’t get overwhelmed with this part. Just use framework to your advantage but in a conversational manner.

One such framework is GAME, meaning define the Goal of the product, discuss main Actions performed on the product. Define the Metrics, then evaluate on the metric priorities.

Try this out on a sample question here: “How would you measure success on Instagram Stories.”

Prompt engineering would involve creating intermediate prompts to generate queries so you can run them, then format the answers into another prompt, and then maybe even generate a graphic. Presumably, this could get endlessly complex.

In general, it brakes down to improving outcomes and reducing costs.

When I was a quant at a bank running valuation models for possible investments, you are tasked with trying to figure out what the value of a thing is. If I could take a company that made $100 in revenue and then spent $40 to make that $60 in profit, and let’s say that company trades at 10x its profit, the value of the company should be ~$600. 

If we could figure out how to reduce costs to $35 without any other effect on the revenue, that $60 in profits would change to $65 and the value should be $650 so, the short term value would be $50. 

Alternatively, if we kept the costs the same, but figured out how to increase revenue, let’s say $100 to $110, the profit would increase for $60 to $70 and then value is $700, a $100 increase. 

You can do the same thing inside a company. One way or another, we are increasing profit by $25 our stock is trading at 10X PE, this activity is worth $250. To do this thing it will cost us $100. Our net benefit is $150, we should do this thing.",2,1738773111.0

if you can get fancy, larger companies will have model ecosystems, where models feed into another.

Postgres on RDS should work fine, especially if you're only keeping 30 days of data—if queries ever get slow, you could look into TimescaleDB for better time-series handling. For transformation, Polars is a great choice over Pandas, and if you ever want more structured pipeline management, dbt could be useful. Your idea of using gRPC in Go for the API makes sense, and for storing models, S3 should work fine unless you need low-latency access, in which case Redis + ONNX Runtime could be a nice alternative. If you ever need to scale, SageMaker or TensorFlow Serving might be worth looking at, but that's probably overkill for now.Overall, your choices are solid, and it looks like you've thought through everything well.

The easiest part of data science is often building the model. The hardest part is often figuring out why you're building a model, who is going to use, how they're going to use it, and how do you get value out of it.

Instead of using a betting model, build a betting *app*, where someone can use your app to evaluate their bets. Not only will you learn more than just modeling, but then you can actually get feedback from users and learn to work through how exactly that works.

Many current challenges that can be tackled with ML lack data, either because of low quality, would take years to collect, carry privacy risks, etc. These problems occur in a wide range of disciplines/industries, from processes that can be matemathically modelled, to random events, if you have data, you can train models.


Training the models is not the problem, but the data (quality and quantity) that is required. If there are some ststistics and known physics behind, you can make use of them to somewhat counteract the data limitations by generating synthetic data and evaluate different algorithms or architectures. 


Techniques such as data augmentation (initially used widely in image recognition applications), are indeed fake data that's been manipulated/altered to counteract bias. If you want a NN to recognise rabbits, but you have only a picture of a white rabbit, you may edit the image and create black, spotted, brown rabbits, then mirror them, rotate them, stretch them, change the backgrounds, etc. Those would be a mix of augmented data and synthetic data that would increase the chances of your algorithm recognising rabbits.


As more data becomes available (you visit a rabbit farm), the most suitable models you already prototyped, can be re-trained, hyperparameters can be further tuned, etc. 


Some ideas behind synthetic data is to allow the development of projects otherwise not viable, to prototype solutions, or to work in parallel different stages of a project. If data collection will take 3 years, you can start exploring candidate solutions based on ""fake"" (a.k.a. synthetic) data. 


Lastly, but less obvious ones. Cases where the data you need is simply not possible to measure with the available technology, or is of unethical to experiment with.


Imagine you need to train a model to predict tissue degeneration under repetitive stress... name it hip cartilage, to predict onset of a joint dissease. Measurements of the biomechanical loads involved (in-vivo) are simply not possible, even if are somewhat viable, large scale studies would be unethical, and they may not fully represent reality anyway. There's a physical barrier to the data. Here comes what has been used for decades in industry, computer simulation tools like FEA, FVM, CFD, and many more. We have relied on these numerical tools to model behaviour of all kinds of materials and processes. And it is the moment now that outputs from these time-intensive simulations can be used to train ML models and be used to predict such behaviours, with extreme advantages in computing time, software license costs, or the capacity to use them in resource-constrained embedded systems. For the example above you'd make a biomechanical simulation (that takes days to complete)  then vary the parameters and repeat it hundreds, thousands of times in computing clusters, then you have data to work with. Data that may be more or less representative of your phenomena, according to the quality of your mathematical simulations, but nonetheless, better than data otherwise unavailable, or so we think.


As you can think the number of examples is limited by your imaginatiom (and available simulation frameworks). Synthetic data is more widely used than most think. AI systems for space systems, you name it, it likely started with synthetic data.


Guess how atmospheric models (weather) work? Yep...  synthetic data (well, a good part). And a fair chunk of modern world economics are based on it, apparently.

mbc26g5,1ighhad,FullStackAI-Alta,"This article idea popped into my head while going through the LangGraph course. As I worked on the first few examples, I got completely drowned into playing with the Graph workflow — it was actually pretty fun. That’s when it hit me: these stateful graphs are super useful for understanding how requests and queries move through an agentic workflow.

So I have some interesting insights and I want to share it with you So please check this out!

mbd7tzj,1ighhad,shroommuu,"I am starting my master's in DS in May but I have a project I'm excited about that I want to start thinking about now. Not necessarily working on yet, but definitely thinking and planning for.

I work in an OB/GYN office as my day job and am interested in reviewing data on OB/GYN appointment access in the United States. I would like to remain in healthcare as a data scientist so I think a project in this area would look good to employers.

I'm not sure where to start looking for datasets. If a dataset doesn't exist, is it outside the scope of a data scientist to collect data via a survey? Honestly I'd go as far as calling doctor's offices to gather the necessary data.

Any suggestions, especially when it comes to maintaining an achievable scope, would be appreciated. I'd hate to bite off more than I can chew for a project that feels near and dear to my heart.",1,1738877660.0
