1) Microsoft Data Science certification 
2) Same as 1 but on coursera with a capstone project.

New here, this may be long winded but any guidance would be amazing.

In my situation, what do you guys think I should ask for my title change to be? My position/title is due for a change in 3 months (They've explicitly informed me my title will likely change to align with the DS work I've been doing, but I have some input regarding this decision.) and the way we scope salaries is using different averages for that specific title for that specific area, in consideration with YOE, education, etc... I don't know really what the whole market is like ATM, and which title will give me more leverage on my resume going forward. They decided to invest in me while I was still an undergrad as a fulltime DE and if I worked out it'd just be trial by fire.

I'm currently a DE (salary 80k) with a bachelor's from a small school in the boot state at an ag-fi company, 2YOE. But my role has been heavily driven by DS. I've built our data platform (databricks focused) out from the ground up (from an empty Azure Resource Group) along with our DS Manager. He is a domain expert who is quite traditional and handles many of the visualizations and tableau/powerbi things, and while he doesn't model much, he has an amazing vision for where we need to focus next. However, he turns to me often for implementation and to go research and find things in the wild that are worth implementing that perhaps we don't yet have. Typically I end up cradle-to-graving the data process. But without him, I wouldn't be able to quickly identify/know where to point myself and begin drilling down with other teams. I'm grdually starting to better understand the domain, though.

My current thoughts are
1. MLE? (Applied MLE since no research?)
2. DS (Associate DS because of YOE?)
3. Full Stack DS (I see this pop up on LinkedIn, but it resonated a bit with me.. is it a title that is taken seriously?)
4. DE/DS/MLE/Python Web Dev/Infra Engineer/Backend Dev?
5. Junior Quant DS? (if that's even a real thing. I'm so focused on the work, my knowledge of the fields is lacking, and google will tell me just about anything exists, but whether that's actually a position seen in the wild in the market is different yknow)

I've ended up implementing some specific applied models (ARIMA, NBeats with exogenous vars, Koopman-inspired models utilizing DMD (Driven by Brunton and Kutz's writings), convolutional types like TimesFM, transformer TS, as well as a Linear Factor Model implementation that our quant tweaked and helped me with implementing. For any that were deployed, I also implemented champion-challenger/rudimentary mlops.
Against pre-existing baselines on out of sample data, things perform enough that they're happy, though I know my gaps in knowledge leave room to be desired. One of my implementations has helped generate around 200k. I've done some multiple linear regressions. But we have 2 research analysts where that's their bread and butter, and tbh they'd get a bit angry with me if I started to encroach on that and I'd like to keep the politics all friendly.
I've also done some motif exploration and set up a basic anomaly detection on sensor data using a matrix profile approach inspired by Eamonn Keough's UCR papers, though after talking with our quant, perhaps I should have used a kalman filter? Jury still out lol), Anytime Before I implement or deliver, I have to do a few whiteboard sessions breaking down how the models work to a director( phd quant ) and the DSM.
Lately I've been building risk analysis pipelines on countries, and 80% of my time hsa been working on a full stack flask app that's going to be the the new data owner for some very specific risk-related customer tracking and analytics. I've created and deployed all the resources from scratch in Azure with Terraform, devops pipelines, or azure cli, assigned the roles, implemented Entra ID, built the data model, and now I'm serving the data I've been building pipelines for. We just hired an intern who will help take some of my responsibilities in DE as long as he works out, but I will retain many of my hats that I currently wear.

The supplementary studying eats up my evenings, but I feel like without it, I wouldn't be able to keep up haha. I also still work a second job in retail to help with my student loans.

Currently, I'm a little over halfway through Elements of Statistical Learning By Tibshirani and Hastie, also been looking at the underlying principles that drive bayesian networks, with a goal in converting certain deterministic models into probabilistic ones. After this, I'm looking to better understand GARCH(I know it is predicated on heteroschedasticity which I've become more familiar with, but not much past that tbh) and VaR for some pipelines I'm anticipating in the near future. After that will probably be an interactive timetabling app for logistics, that I haven't read up on very much yet.

But like, say a title pays less in my specific area's market (I'll just have to research based off the recommendations), but gives me more leverage in applications processes or increases my appeal (I understand nothing will raise my appeal until I get a masters. Looking at that next year or two after paying off student loans).
I know it sounds lazy, or like I didn't research what this role should be called, but I'm so all over the place idk where to start and what would just be confirmation bias or me misinterpreting things, etc... There aren't really any Data Scientists where I'm at and I don't have anybody in my circle I can ask. It feels more overwhelming than the work itself, haha. But any advice from you guys would be awesome.",1,1744613941.0

mn3tkpt,1jyq1tk,Mnemo_Semiotica,"I'm looking for upskilling paths for some people I work with. I'm the data science head at a startup, working directly with 3 data scientists and an actuary. Everyone on my team has a Masters or more in their education background and are highly skilled in their specialties. My inclination is to find part-time ""bootcamp""-ish options that potentially have remote, live class environments, or at least some type of social dynamic amongst the cohorts. Something like what Galvanize Data Science used to offer, but for people who are working. I'm not looking for things like DataCamp, though I do think that direction is valid. I'm hoping to find something with a set curriculum, a beginning and end, 3-6 months. 

2 of the DSs could benefit from a deeper understanding of architecting systems and software design, possibly more in the ML Engineer realm. We're currently spending a lot of time building systems and workflows, and their backgrounds have no production software engineering, which has become a pain point. 

The actuary I work with is phasing into more modeling that traditionally would live in the DS space. A DS bootcamp with part-time options seems like it would be ideal in their case.

I haven't interacted with the bootcamp spaces in a long time now, and it seems like many have gone by the wayside. I have thought of some of those bootcamps as being low quality. For example, General Assembly seemed that way to me, unless my understanding was off. I'm looking for good quality and part-time options.

I do use chat GPT quite a bit though. Often for high level stuff (is this division of responsibilities between classes appropriate? Is this design overlooking anything?) or the conceptually easy but tedious stuff (write me a pydantic model for this json; translate this pandas code into something numba-compatible). I come to DS from a math background and am mostly self taught as a programmer, so it's been very helpful to ask about best practices or libraries I'm not familiar with (is there an out of the box option for [domain specific cross validation requirements]? How do I unit tests?)

Where it fails is for more complex coding tasks. It will often give you something that works in a stupid or obvious way that misses the nuance. For example I once asked it to give me code to join one dataframe with rolling aggregations of another, with daily data over several years. It wanted to do just join first, filter on date, then aggregate, which you can imagine created a ridiculous memory bottleneck.

mnj0sae,1k0zcye,Atmosck,"this is MLOPS - how do you deliver a model, and how do you feed the model?

Whatever data enrichment you're doing should happen to both your training data and your prediction inputs. Really the design of your training set should simulate the inputs you'll have at prediction data, by having a separate routine for building your training data that stops short of any transformations that should be applied to the present data - so mostly joins. Then store your ""raw"" training in a sql database or something, and append this daily (or whatever) for future training. Then you can have shared code between your prediction pipeline and your training/validation/etc routines that applies feature engineering (basically any new columns you create from what you already have) and preprocessing (normalization and one-hot encoding and stuff) so that your model is getting matching inputs in both settings.

A lazier approach might have a single training script that queries a bunch of raw data sources (and maybe even has to carefully pace API calls) and does potentially slow aggregations and stuff every time you train. But having this extra stop where you put the joined data in a database before you do other stuff to it, gives you a clean way to separate out the logic that also needs to be applied to the current data for prediction, and it avoids doing redundant work.

If you are giving your .train and your .predict functions different kinds of data, your result won't just be inaccurate, it will be nonsensical. Like all 0s or something.

Ultimately a machine learning pipeline is some data sources and a chain of things that have .transform and sometimes .fit functions and then a landing spot for what comes out the other side. The beginning and end of that chain might differ between training and your prediction setting, but the steps in between should share code as much as possible to ensure consistency, and should use data storage to avoid doing redundant work.",2,1744861370.0

1) The company I worked at sent direct / white mail every month, 500k pieces of paper and it was always done, and they were incredibly resistant to the idea of creating control groups.  Then we cannot contact people and we won't sell as much.  The conversion on these things were less than 1%.  But the business supported them because ""hey we've always done it, we know our business, what do these data kids know.""

Then I presented this not in sales but in return.  Ie how much did these campaigns bring in and compared this to the costs.  I called this crazy new way of thinking Return on Invest... super genius right? Sure its gonna catch on.

But this showed that most of these campaigns cost the company rather than generating returns.  

Suddenly the department and business is on board with doing control groups and tests.  What changed? It was positioned in a way that they understood and cared about.

  
2) A junior data scientist wanted to build the fanciest model possible to predict churn.  He wanted all the data.  He spent months arguing with Data Privacy (we are in the EU) and got nowhere, and his model was crap.  

Eventually this got reassigned to me.  I built a quick model based on how the customers acted, which I understood after talking to the business.  This model saved the business ‚Ç¨1m a month.

Most people are interpreting it as you saying that storytelling is useless, and you should only focus on complicated techniques that interest you.

But I don't get the sense that that is what you were trying to say.

In this industry, there is a LARGE proportion of people that are doing what I would call ""performance theatre.""

They look like they are delivering value and big impacts, but really, they are just storytellers that don't provide anything of value.

It is also really hard to distinguish the two unless you yourself are an expert in the field.

Storytelling is important, but storytelling is not the same thing as actually delivering value.

You can convince people you are delivering value with storytelling, but you can't actually deliver value with storytelling alone.

The actual value and business impact always comes from the insights and changed decisions/workflow that stem from your deployed solutions.

I cannot tell you how many churn solutions I've seen where people telling me they saved the company X million dollars a year, but when you actually ask how they determined that number, it is all just storytelling bullshit.

Storytelling is an extremely important skill, but it's not the value driver, IMO.

Now, I know some people will get offended because the entire job of most data analysts is to tell stories, which IMO doesn't provide much actual value or impact most of the time.

But I'm biased because I focus more on predictive analytics problems rather than data analysis problems. So your mileage may vary :)",2,1744904839.0

So model a would have 4 different model instances trained on training set 1-4. This will allow you to quantify the approximate uncertainty in the data and model. Then you can compare the bias / variance of each model to see if each one is overfitting a specific sub portion of your data.

You're predicting a distribution for each customer, who individually would get quotes at uneven intervals. So your cross-validation should simulate the past-future barrier that you'll have in production.

If you split randomly you can have leakage thanks to long-term trends. Say for example 2024 had a 10% higher purchase rate than 2023. Then your model will learn from 80% of quotes in 2024 and apply that knowledge to predicting the other 20%, and appear smarter than it would actually be.

mn7fbhl,1jzml32,Cuidads,"Most current deployments are just scripted workflows in the backend, usually by a RAG framework. When the scope is narrow and the implementation is good, they can appear to have agency, but that‚Äôs all it is.

These semi-autonomous systems can be very much useful (business value wise), but they‚Äôre not as dramatic a shift from what we had a few years ago as they might seem. The main difference is that natural language now triggers workflows instead of code or UI buttons. It‚Äôs essentially the next step after low-code and no-code tools. 

Anyone claiming to have truly agentic AI is almost certainly working within a very tightly constrained use case (or lying for marketing). 

The core issues haven‚Äôt gone away. You still can‚Äôt debug LLM-driven systems like traditional software. Even with trace logs and prompt chains, it‚Äôs like trying to reason with a hallucinating intern who forgets what they just did. Agents still struggle to maintain state or recover from failure in a robust way. Tool use is fragile, API name mismatches, auth errors, or schema changes can break everything, and unlike humans, agents can‚Äôt adapt on the fly. Safety and control are real concerns too; no one wants an agent that spams emails or corrupts data, so human-in-the-loop remains essential. And perhaps most critically, we still lack good ways to evaluate these systems. Outside of narrow task benchmarks, it‚Äôs hard to say whether they‚Äôre actually performing well or just getting lucky.

Things can always change quickly. This could look very different in a year, but I suspect the limitations are fundamental to LLM architecture, and maybe even to neural networks and backpropagation at their core. If that‚Äôs the case, and to put it a bit bluntly, most of these so-called agentic systems are really just rebranded expert systems from the ‚Äô80s and on, now with a natural language interface layered on top. The backend is still a brittle web of conditional logic that doesn‚Äôt generalize. Two years ago, I wasn‚Äôt sure how deep the problem ran, but at this point I find myself fully aligned with Yann LeCun‚Äôs perspective on this:

Now, try introducing LASSO or some other fancy regularization-based model selection technique to a room full of economists with 20+ years of industry experience. Chances are, they won‚Äôt buy into it. There‚Äôs often skepticism around methods that feel like a black box or require a deeper understanding of optimization and penalty terms.

Let‚Äôs be honest, most data scientists, economists, and analysts aren‚Äôt following the latest literature. A lot of them are still using the same tricks they learned two decades ago. And it‚Äôs not going to be the new guy with a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù optimization method who suddenly changes how things are done.

To give you an example of what counts as a ‚Äúclassical‚Äù modeling approach in practice. Back when I worked a government job, I had to practically battle with economists just to get them to consider using mixed models instead of a simple linear regression. Even when it was clearly the wrong tool for the data structure, they‚Äôd still lean on what they knew.

Why? Because it's familiar. Because it doesn‚Äôt attract attention. And because most people in the workplace aren't there to innovate, they're there to get the job done and keep their job secure.

At least with fewer variables backwards or stepwise is often preferred. Hastie, one of the authors of ESL/ISL, argues to use forward for statistical learning (prediction) over the other two. He‚Äôs also responsible for furthering the optimization of ridge regression. 

Many statisticians won‚Äôt even automate it for experiments, but manually observe each layer.

It may not be better than other feature selection techniques, such as exhaustive selection, genetic algorithms, shadow features (Boruta), importance filtering, or of course the painstaking application of domain knowledge.

You're dealing with a convergence of two things. First there's been a shrinking of entry level data scientist positions compared to 5 years ago. At the same time there's been an explosion of data science and analytics masters degree programs. So you're entering a market with fewer open positions and more qualified applicants. 

The big issue is that, while a hiring manager might look at your experience and understand how it relates to a data scientist position, they're likely never going to see your application. It's the purpose of HR to filter out applications that don't meet the standards. Positions are very often getting a thousand applications. 95% are dropped automatically because they don't meet a qualification, often Visa status, but also experience. 

Let's say the HR rep gets 30 resumes of folks with a master's degree or more. Why would she add your resume to that list of resumes that she sends to the hiring manager when she probably doesn't even understand how your experience even applies? She's in human resources, not data science, so if the job listed on your resume doesn't say data scientist she won't know how it's related.  

She also can't send the hiring manager every single resume that might qualify, because her whole job is to filter out resumes and the hiring manager doesn't have time to go through or 200 resumes themself.

Ironically enough, you're a great candidate for a data science master's degree. I was in a similar situation.

I know several recent BS grads that work at Deloitte and Accenture. 

2) Another option are firms that have lighter data requirements and heavy requirements in the subject matter field. I work in Pharma and this is common.  We have departments loaded with BS data analysts. In science based industries, a combination of the subject matter and the data is where the power comes from so in a lot of cases these companies are fine with pairing BS data people with PhD physical scientists

1. Have portfolio projects.  
Not having any is a big red flag for this level. Added bonus if you're scraping your own data instead of fitting some sklearn classifier to a pre-cleaned Kaggle set.

2. There are other ways of getting the ""data scientist"" title. 

\- Freelance/consulting work for small businesses that are okay with you using their name on your resume

\- Volunteer orgs. I volunteered as a data scientist for multiple orgs and included that on my resume

\- Horizontal, internal moves: It's more important to do data science work than to be a titled a data scientist. Try to get projects where you can gain experience. And eventually you may be able to move into that position within your own company.

3. Have a portfolio website. 

This is more common for CS jobs, but having a portfolio site will help you stand out from the pile in data science apps or when reaching out to recruiters. Only 7% of people actually do this.

mn3aeh5,1jxtzs1,BrisklyBrusque,"In insurance, risk is often modeled using GLMs. The outcome variable is usually claim amount, claim frequency, loss ratio, loss ratio relativity, or some other measure of loss. Interestingly, the outcome variable tends to be highly skewed. Think Auto insurance for example: maybe 1 out of every 25 policyholders reports a claim in a given accident year. A few claims are small, a small number of claims are big, and a very small (but expensive) fraction are exceptionally big.¬†And so the outcome variable is often modeled using a Tweedie distribution, which is a simple zero-inflated continuous distribution.

How we transform and massage the data can have a lot of impact. Capping outliers, scaling variables, and using imputation or credibility weighting (an actuarial technique) are some good tricks.

More advanced teams are using GAMs, Boosting, ensembles, neural networks, bootstrap regression, regularized regression, etc. For models that are filed with the Dept. of Insurance, GLMs are often preferred because models subject to DOI auditing have to be explainable. For rating and retention models, black boxes are OK, and more teams are using SHAP values for interpretation.

Do the data need to be time series? Not always. Sometimes, you can simply use each policy term (one year of data and one year of exposure) as a row in the training data. However, you may have a competitive advantage by adding trends to the data (for example, computing the trending average loss over a four year span and including it as a predictor).",2,1744650531.0

mmuyz5f,1jxtzs1,EstablishmentDry1074,"Hey there! It sounds like you're diving into some interesting topics in the financial sector. For fraud detection and risk modeling, there are a few areas you might want to focus on. Common techniques include anomaly detection, supervised and unsupervised learning models, and statistical methods like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Since you‚Äôre proficient in causal inference and statistical tests, you‚Äôre already on the right track!

In the context of fraud detection, common methods like outlier detection and clustering techniques (e.g., k-means) are often used, alongside time series anomaly detection for detecting fraudulent activity over time. Models like XGBoost or CatBoost have gained popularity due to their performance in classification tasks. It‚Äôs also important to understand feature engineering and how to deal with imbalanced datasets, since fraud data is often highly skewed.

Risk modeling can involve techniques like Value at Risk (VaR), credit scoring, and Monte Carlo simulations. Depending on the role, you might need to get familiar with how these models integrate with financial data systems.

In practice, anomaly detection often comes up in fraud detection, so methods like Z-score, ARIMA, and SARIMA are used in time series, but you may also encounter more advanced approaches like Isolation Forest or autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection.

mmsm4ng,1jxdlfg,techdaddykraken,"I strongly believe in product-first marketing.

Marketing itself is a stochastic process reliant on non-deterministic outputs.

There are niche areas where it is possible to identify true causal relationships, such as an e-commerce only vertical with end-to-end tracking for revenue and engagement. 

But by and large when you talk about large-scale marketing operations that involve different aspects of paid search, SEO, web development, display advertising, out-of-home advertising, remarketing, etc, it quickly becomes a system that is more noise than signal.

Explaining the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs of the system‚Äôs mechanics to stakeholders falls on deaf ears. When you try to explain probability theory, data structures, learning models, all they want to do is argue over details they don‚Äôt understand, because their confirmation bias usually drives their decision-making. (I THINK this is the best way to do marketing, or I THINK we can find a solution under this budget figure, or I THINK we can hit this metric goal). Very often the stakeholders who do this, are not part of the marketing dynamic. They are an operations director looking from the outside-in, a CEO, a finance VP, etc.

For a wide variety of reasons, the methods that most companies use to perform marketing are backwards and illogical. It‚Äôs an environment full of noise, circular reasoning, fallacies, biases, and internal politics.

This can be said the same for most departments in most companies, but I believe marketing gets the worst of these actions, because for large part they allow it. My pet theory is that the marketing industry has not done enough to standardize the education pathway into a licensed profession, as well as marketing individuals being more timid and complicit. 

All of these concepts culminate in a marketing department at most companies where results are just guesses driven by vibes and poorly formed conclusions. 

For those reasons, I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äòdata-driven marketing‚Äô. I‚Äôm a firm believer that you shouldn‚Äôt look at the data at all. 

Thought experiment: would Steve Jobs have designed the original MacBook any differently if he had a team of marketers analyzing past results from Google Ads and Google Analytics to identify the products which consumers liked the best and were more likely to purchase?

I don‚Äôt think he would have, nor should he have. I think he would‚Äôve told them to kick rocks, and he would‚Äôve gone on to build the MacBook how he envisioned.

Today? I think most companies get so caught up in the enamor of what marketing should be as an ideal. They want the pretty, neat, organized marketing that is tied up in a bow, and gives them the exact results they want and predict.

Unless they are equally willing to invest in the educational and technological components to make that vision a reality, they are more likely to continuously fail than not. 

Time and again I have seen companies attempt to perform ‚Äòdata-driven marketing‚Äô without even having a dedicated data engineer on staff for data wrangling and cleaning. Or having a dedicated BI solution, instead each performance marketer is using separate solutions in a disjoint manner. Or having standardized data dictionaries for data sources and calculation methodologies. Or ensuring stakeholders take basic courses in statistics and data science so that they can understand common terminology.

To that end, I believe a group of educated, experienced, intelligent individuals, using round-table discussions to drive innovation, is the best way to perform marketing today. It removes all of the external noise and focuses solely on your human experience as the driver for your decision-making. 

I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that the majority of working class Americans are stretched to the brink in terms of their finances. Many forgoing meals, dental work, basic household repairs, and taking on debt just to survive. I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that we‚Äôre in the midst of a fascist takeover, with our president using the institutions of our government to enrich him and his cabinet.

I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that China is quickly overtaking the U.S. in nearly all areas as they relate to economic growth and prosperity. 

I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are propagandized through social media. I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are under-educated and have an inflated sense of self-worth compared to the rest of the world due to incentivized nationalism over the past century.

I don‚Äôt need data to tell me that the majority of Americans are getting subpar nutrition due to corporations putting toxins in our food and water supply.

But God forbid you bring these points up in a marketing meeting, every stakeholder will give you the stink-eye and escort you out, because it doesn‚Äôt fit their picture-perfect version of marketing, where their stable of meek marketers timidly comply with their biased decisions, acting as their personal ‚Äògo-fers‚Äô to fetch them more leads on demand whenever the numbers on the charts don‚Äôt live up to their unrealistic expectations.

Most forms of marketing innovation fail due to external stakeholder pressure, not a lack of ability to innovate using skills or a lack of technology/budget.

Instead of paying a team of data scientists for advanced modeling, that money would be FAR better spent, from a return on investment perspective, in educating core stakeholders on the basic mechanics of how modern technology works from a networking, algorithm, data structure  perspective, and how probability theory and basic statistics work, as well as the psychographic principles which influence most human behavior.

doing that, will lead to far greater returns for marketing investment, than trying to implement complex modeling beyond your means.",-1,1744491720.0

mmhb1zg,1jwbevk,enteringinternetnow,"Here are some key skills for a DS. I‚Äôll start with the basics as you asked specific to DS who are just starting out -

1. Understand the problem you‚Äôre working on well: most entry level DS are guilty of it. They jump directly into the modeling part without much understanding of the problem & data. Spend a bit of time in this step to make sure you understand the problem well. 

2. Exploratory data analysis: this is another key skill that doesn‚Äôt get as much attention. Do a whole bunch of EDA to understand the data. Understanding the data well helps you build better models.


3. Flawless pipelines: Make sure you‚Äôre able to write pipeline codes without errors. For example, ensure there are no duplications in your workflows & do sense testing on every step. Double check your work always!!

These are a bit more advanced ones: 

4. Domain knowledge: this is the absolute most crucial thing in my opinion and most DS are oblivious to. Knowledge of the domain helps you understand the problem you‚Äôre working on, use the right features & story tell what your model is doing. This in my opinion makes a ‚Äúfull stack data scientist‚Äù 

5. Storytelling: explaining & convincing the stakeholders on why they should use your (models‚Äô) recommendations. Having domain skills helps you tell the right story. PowerPoint skills + communication are the essentials here. A linear regression that‚Äôs explained well has a better chance of acceptance than a deep neural net with ensembling & RAG deployed on the cloud with poor storytelling.

You're right that the ""full-stack data scientist"" has become more myth than reality ‚Äî most real-world DS roles now require specialization + some business context rather than doing everything end to end. But IMO, the survivability of your skillset long-term comes down to one thing:

üëâ Are you close to the signal?

* Are you building or interpreting models that directly impact decisions or outcomes?
* Are your outputs measurable, valuable, and ideally hard to replace by vanilla AI/automation?

That could be in product analytics, ML modeling, recommender systems, etc. It doesn‚Äôt really matter which domain as long as:

1. You're close to action (not just cleaning or wiring data)
2. You can speak both model and business
3. You're hands-on enough to experiment and deploy

Your product DS friends and your data eng friends are both partly right. But the long-term moat isn‚Äôt in tools ‚Äî it‚Äôs in:

* Thinking in hypotheses
* Designing solid experiments
* Building explainable, testable models
* And being able to adapt when the tools change (because they always will)

1. **Data Engineering fundamentals**¬†(ETL/ELT thinking, data modeling, cloud infra basics, SQL wizardry) are probably gonna stick around. Tools change, but the¬†*need*¬†for clean, reliable data pipelines isn't going anywhere. Someone's gotta build and maintain the foundation.
2. **Solid ML/Stats knowledge**¬†(beyond just¬†`model.fit()`) is also key. Think understanding¬†*why*¬†models work, how to evaluate them properly, experimental design, causal inference. AI might automate basic model building, but interpreting results, designing good experiments, and understanding limitations? That's human insight.
3. **Cloud skills**¬†are becoming table stakes across the board. Doesn't mean you need to be a cloud architect, but knowing your way around AWS/GCP/Azure for data storage, processing, and maybe basic model deployment is huge.

The ""full stack"" thing might be fading for¬†*entry-level*, but having T-shaped skills (deep in one area, broad awareness in others) is golden. A DE who understands ML workflows, or an analyst who knows how data gets ingested? Super valuable.

**TL;DR:**¬†You're not totally overthinking it, but don't get paralyzed. Strong fundamentals in SQL, Python, stats/ML principles, and basic cloud literacy seem like the most durable bets across¬†*most*¬†paths. AI will likely automate simpler tasks in¬†*all*¬†areas, pushing folks towards more complex problem-solving.

Leaning into what genuinely interests you is probably the best move long-term, 'cause you'll need to constantly learn anyway. Just make sure you're building those solid fundamentals along the way! Good luck!",1,1744733377.0
mn97la7,1jwbevk,crowcanyonsoftware,"You're not overthinking‚Äîit‚Äôs a smart question, especially in this AI-flavored economy where the ""most employable"" skillset keeps shifting. Here's the distilled take:

**1. Business sense is the moat‚Äînow what complements it best?**  
Assuming you‚Äôve got business context down (as you said), the edge comes from being able to *deliver insights at scale*. That means:

* **Data fluency (SQL, Python, basic stats) is table stakes.**
* **Cloud + software fundamentals** (e.g., Git, Docker, basic CI/CD, using AWS/GCP) offer serious leverage‚Äîeven if you don‚Äôt build pipelines daily, knowing how things are deployed makes you more collaborative and valuable.
* **Communication and storytelling** will always beat pure technical flash.

**2. Data engineering vs. product DS: both are valid paths, with tradeoffs.**

* **Product DS** = closer to decision-making, faster feedback loops, good if you like experimentation and being in the ‚Äúwhy it matters‚Äù zone.
* **Data Engineering** = deeper infrastructure, slower iteration, but scalable impact and often more job openings‚Äîespecially in AI teams feeding LLMs or real-time systems.

**3. AI and tooling abstraction is real.** You‚Äôre right to be wary of building deep expertise in tools that get abstracted. So rather than mastering a specific stack, focus on:

* **Problem-solving frameworks** (e.g., causal inference, experiment design, pipeline design).
* **Learning how to learn** new tools quickly (most companies want adaptability, not tool memorization).
* **Keeping an eye on AI integration**‚Äîknowing how to plug models into pipelines or use vector databases, for instance, is already proving valuable.

**4. Long-term resilience? Probably hybrid profiles.** The most resilient data scientists tomorrow will likely be:

* Conversant in ML and engineering (not necessarily expert).
* Able to ship experiments or prototypes.
* Good at translating technical findings into strategy.

So, your instincts are spot on: specialize, but stay general enough to adapt. Pick what interests you most *within* those growing zones. If you lean product DS, sharpen cloud + software fundamentals. If you're drawn to engineering, build that, but stay in touch with business and ML needs.

mmk5zwf,1jwlf3f,Cuidads,"Demand forecasting doesn‚Äôt typically require causal inference, so I‚Äôm curious what specific problem you are trying to solve.

Are you trying to estimate the effect of an action, like a price change or a marketing campaign, on demand? That would be a causal question. But causal inference is not a predictive tool. It is used to isolate the impact of interventions, and doing it properly requires strong domain knowledge to correctly handle confounders, colliders, and the overall causal structure. It is also brittle. If you get the assumptions wrong, your conclusions can be worse than doing nothing.

In short, causal inference is not a drop-in replacement for forecasting. It addresses a different type of question. Do not chase a buzzword without a clear problem that justifies it.

I am going to go out on a limb here. Based on what you wrote, and the fact that you did not include any specifics, I would advise against taking this on right now. As a junior, you likely do not yet have the statistical grounding or domain context to drive this kind of methodological shift. Most likely, the senior folks will hear your pitch, quietly realize it lacks depth, and politely disregard it. Not because you spoke up, but because it will signal that you do not yet fully understand either forecasting or causal inference.

That does not mean you should not contribute ideas. You absolutely should. But choose your timing carefully. Do not spend your credibility on a big pivot that you are not ready to defend.",24,1744378197.0
mmp6q4c,1jwlf3f,Professional_Push_20,"If the current demand model forecasting isn‚Äôt performing well, a good starting hypothesis is that the features don‚Äôt fully capture the drivers of demand. 

Thinking the demand drivers through as a casual inference problem can be a great way to develop a deep and shared understanding of the domain. 

But start simply and don‚Äôt get technical early: simply spending some time with some people who are domain experts sketching out a ‚Äòdrivers tree‚Äô i.e. ‚Äòwhat drives what‚Äô may be all you need. 

You only need to get more technical if the domain experts don‚Äôt have a full picture that allows you identify the right features. At that point, you can focus on where the ambiguity or uncertainty lies and suggest causal inference approaches to figure it out. 

Starting simply and practically will help bring people on the journey with you. It unlikely anyone will object to you speaking time to understand the domain and features. They might object to you going down a technical route that is very new to you.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Causal Inference

o¬†¬† Unlike predictive inference (where given the cause you predict the outcome), causal inference is concerned with why, if, and to what extent a cause leads to an outcome. Example: Whether a particular drug cured an illness ‚Äì if yes then how effective it was, or if no then what other factors might have cured it.

o¬†¬† Potential Outcomes refer to all possible outcomes to a situation. Generally, Y(0) refers to outcome when treatment was not applied, while Y(1) refers to outcome when it was applied. ‚ÄúTreatment‚Äù is the cause we are interested in, like taking a drug, applying a marketing strategy etc. It is impossible to observe both Y(0) and Y(1), so we cannot measure the exact impact of treatment Y(1) ‚Äì Y(0). However, we can measure the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) = E\[Y(1) ‚Äì Y(0)\].

o¬†¬† Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) are a way to visualize causal inference. In DAG, nodes are directed and a previously traversed nodes cannot be revisited (hence acyclic). DAG allows to map the series of causal steps that led to the outcome.",3,1744461473.0

Another step is to plot it against your target variable - does the relationship look linear? If it's non-linear, maybe you need to apply a transformation for your model to be able to capture the relationship. If your variable is integers with a relatively small range and there isn't a clear relationship with the target variable, maybe you should treat it as categorical. How correlated is it with other variables? Does its product with any other variable have a strong correlation with the target? Maybe you need an interaction feature.

mm3qi78,1juo7ue,enteringinternetnow,"Good points, OP! MOST interviews don‚Äôt test the really ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù / ‚Äúflashy new thing‚Äù concepts. Because most companies don‚Äôt need that yet. Everyone is going to test the foundations to see if they‚Äôre strong. If you have it, you can easily learn the advanced ones. 

In my opinion, these are the foundations

1. SQL - joins, window functions, subqueries, query optimization
2. Database design - applies to more structured data
3. Statistics - distributions, CLT, confidence intervals, inferences - R2, p value, z value etc. 
4. Probability - conditional probability 
5. ML theory - least squares, logistical regression, VIF, variable selection, model selection, cross validation/resampling, classification - confusion matrix, bias variance tradeoff
6. Practical ML - regularization/scaling, missing values handling, outlier detection
7. Coding 

These are the most broad topics. Could be different for specific industries (NLP, social network modeling etc) 

Good luck!",74,1744146650.0

Fortunately, the two go hand in hand as data is an amazing way (the best) to dive into a concept and become an expert,, especially in comparison to other people. On the other hand, i know too many Data scientists who either produce non-relevant output or are poorly utilised because the business has no clue how to use them.

Second is English. You will need to be able to articulate complex technical topics clearly and succinctly. That comes from strong writing skills and communication in general i.e. public speaking and presenting.

A distant third is programming and software engineering skills. Honestly, I wouldn't focus on this at all until you've mastered the fundamentals.

I recommend the following courses in high school:

* Calculus III (you might have to take it from a university. I took a course from my Alma mater in high school)
* AP Macroeconomics
* AP Microeconomics
* AP Statistics
* AP Computer Science

College:

* Enroll in statistics and computer science dual degree or even statistics and economics with a focus in data science
* Courses
   * Discrete Mathematics
   * Linear Algebra
   * Statistics courses should focus on data science, programming in Python and Machine Learning
   * Econometrics (make sure there is some programming)
   * Computer Science (focus in data science)

Internships

* Apply to internships as early as you can
* Work on personal projects or even volunteer doing data analysis for non-profit or business
* Get a part time job in college to earn extra money and work experience
* Work as a research assistant doing data science work.
   * In my senior year, I was helping a PhD student with statistical analysis. I got course credit and experience to land my first job after graduation.

Networking

* Network with data science professionals as early as you can to understand the industry
* Join local data science meetup groups in your area to learn new technologies",2,1744212512.0
mm7e4k0,1jv4xqf,triggerhappy5,"You're a junior in high school. Enjoy high school, study hard, get into college and choose the cheapest option that is still pretty good (CC for 1-2 years, then transfer in-state is probably the smartest way to go about it). Do computer science, statistics, mathematics, or something along those lines. Try to get an undergrad internship if you can, a good GPA and networking is what you need the most for this.

I have never seen a data science position that was open to a high school grad, and I would say most of the good ones are looking for a Master's or PhD. So grad school is going to be the real thing that matters, and you'll want to make sure you aren't in debt after undergrad, and that you have good grades to get into a good program. GT and UT have great, cheap online MS programs, obviously Berkeley, MIT, Stanford are kind of a level above but much more expensive. If you did the right things in undergrad, you can get grants that will pay for a whole PhD at a lot of these schools (but it is highly competitive, so 3.8+ GPA, 170 quant GRE, and undergrad internships or research is a must). 

For now, like I said, just have fun and focus on learning, not trying to build your resume. And FWIW, specifically regarding that path, learning the math early is gonna be essential for understanding the logic behind coding and data structures, so I wouldn't think too much about that path and just focus on the curriculum offered by your high school and then college.",3,1744203820.0
mm7dn4g,1jv4xqf,Chaoticgaythey,"Most data scientists I know have engineering or statistics heavy degrees (STEM, some econ, social science, and similar). Datascience as a field is extremely broad. Figure out what general area you'd want to be in (finance is always training juniors and profitable, but has lower salary caps than tech, tech isn't always profitable and experiences layoffs, but hashigher income usually, healthcare is really stable and sometimes pays well, but you might be working for an insurance company screwing people out of healthcare, and adtech is just kind of soulless, but has lots of exit opportunities).

Once you generally have an idea for which section you want, try to find what degrees will get you there:
Engineering (ChE and EE have a lot of transferable analytics and modeling in my experience) will open doors in most roles except for a handful of healthcare jobs while various degrees tend to be a bit more field specific. Remember that field specific knowledge is extremely valuable as a datascientist.

You'll probably want at least a masters (eventually). Some roles generally need a PhD, but I really wouldn't say to do one unless you won't hate the 5-7+ years of grinding for it. You can usually start as an analyst and get valuable experience with a BS though. 

For skills, try to take some programming classes along the way and do programming related projects/research/internships. The more you can show competency the easier the search will be. I never formally learned SQL but it was fairly easy to figure out on my own. Make sure you learn a bit about cloud computing (I use Spark a lot which let's Python and SQL kind of blend together).

It'll be a lot of work. Make sure it's really what you want. I'd say a lot of us kind of end up here unintentionally, but we also ended up on this track before DataScience(tm) really was a thing.",1,1744203647.0

mm88gta,1jv4xqf,trustsfundbaby,"To answer your questions:

1. Typically no. But for a highschooler it could be beneficial for trying to find an internship. A lot of people think they can get ""certified"" in data science or data analytics and you can't. Its like saying you can get ""certified"" to be a mathematician, you can. You have to get a college degree or have many years of work experience/published research.

2. Normally getting an internship as a highschooler is rare, at least I don't remember anyone getting on when I was in highschool 15 years ago. I've also never seen a highschool intern anywhere I've worked. Best place to look are the companies career page/indeed/LinkedIn. Most internship postings get published at the start of fall semester so the companies can find who they want for summer. So look around mid August and apply regardless of lack of experience or what year you are in college.

3. I personally believe most online ""road to data scientist"" programs are scams, even if they are free. They act like this path is linear. It is not. You will learn all these tools (sql, python, math) at the same time. They also act like you can learn everything in a year. You cannot. Think about everything you had to learn to get to doing basic calculus. Now you are stepping into a field where calculus is one of the basic concept you must apply. College will teach you everything you need to know to get started. If you want to get started now learn python and use the open source libraries like scikit-learn as a black box to make ML models.",1,1744213253.0
mm8dduv,1jv4xqf,DisgustingCantaloupe,"There are many paths to data science because there is a lot of variability in what a data science role looks like... However I would say the bar for becoming a data scientist is getting higher as the field becomes more mature.

Full-stop, I would not waste your money on certifications or boot-camps. There was a time when the data scientist field was first beginning where that was a viable path, but I don't think it is any longer. Industry is typically looking for people with a high degree of expertise and experience for data science roles.

A bachelor's degree in a related field like statistics, data science, or computer science is not even sufficient in many cases. If you're lucky and/or really stand-out from the crowd with published research as well as internships then you may be able to land a data scientist job with a bachelor's alone. I've known one person personally who was able to land a DS job through an internship he did during undergrad.

A master's degree and PhD is a better bet these days. That was the entry-level threshold at both places I've been hired (the only exceptions were very exceptional BS holders but they were very rare).

Undergrad majors you should choose from are statistics, data science (if available), and computer science. Bonus points if you double-major. Ensure you're taking the necessary math and probability/statistics courses that you'd need to prep you for a solid graduate program (linear algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Experimental Design, Regression).

Pick your undergrad program wisely. You want to find a program that has a track record of empowering the undergrad students to complete substantial research projects that lead to conference presentations and journal publications. The program should also have a track record of its students finding relevant internships (the program will often help match students with local internship opportunities).",1,1744214696.0

Data science is still a new field and it's a very broad one so I would suggest you look at studying computer science, software engineering or statistics over an actual data science program for your primary study, but pick the areas that interest you most in data science (ie, deep learning, forecasting, NLP) for additional courses and training. 

Do not get a BS in Data Science. You'll be competing with the CS majors for some roles and with stats majors for other roles.

There is no certification in data science that is an industry standard, and for that matter there's no standard analyst cert that has the same weight as a CCNA. Your portfolio of projects you've done and how you can speak to it will matter most. I've been in the field a decade, have management experience but I haven't gotten past a phone screen because I don't have that specific experience the company is looking for, ie they want five years of time series or three years of GenAI application development, etc. 

As for internships, most internships I've seen are for grad students or PhD candidates. I've offered one for a high school student when I was at a prior company but that was an example of nepotism (CDO's nephew wanted a job) rather than anything that aligned with company goals.

Some tips that have worked for me or people I know:

‚Ä¢ **Use filters aggressively** on sites like [Wellfound (ex AngelList)](https://wellfound.com) or **remote-friendly job boards** like We Work Remotely, RemoteOK, or Otta. You‚Äôll still need to dig through the noise, but there are solid finds.

‚Ä¢ **Search for companies, not jobs.** Build a list of companies that are known for remote-first culture (e.g., GitLab, Automattic, Zapier) and check their careers pages directly.

‚Ä¢ **Reddit and Discord** communities sometimes surface openings before they hit job boards. Look at r/datasciencejobs, r/remotejs (not just JS), or niche Discords.

‚Ä¢ **Referrals still matter.** A lot of remote jobs are not widely posted‚Äîinternal or network-based hires are common. If you can, post your interest in relevant forums with your skillset.



And yeah, LinkedIn‚Äôs filters are honestly pretty bad right now for finding *truly* remote roles. You‚Äôre not imagining that.

Better places to check:

* We Work Remotely ‚Äì Data Jobs
* Remotive.io ‚Äì Data Science

* AngelList Talent (search by ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù, filter for early-stage startups)

* [CrunchDAO](https://crunchdao.com): ML competition w/ $USDC rewards (no resumes, async)
* Numerai: Similar vibe, model-based earnings
* \[Kaggle competitions + freelance gigs on Upwork, Toptal, etc.\]

You see, with hiring and interviews of juniors I really like to give the them the floor and that opportunity to present it and if you do this with passion, there is nothing more captivating than that. In this field we deal with a lot of stakeholders so if you can simply explain the problem statement, your motivation, the different methods you used and why and the impact then super! 

Now I could give you some pointers and talk about a few projects you could do related to, let‚Äôs say, predictive analytics where you can show off some time series analyses, data visualization, or something with segmentation using clustering to cover feature engineering and some unsupervised learning, or even a sentiment analysis with some cool NLP techniques and data mining methods for modeling but for me at least if you have a project that you pour your heart into and tell a story, you‚Äôll be set, stakeholders eat this shit up. 

Another tip is it also helps a lot when the project in question is tied to relevant domain knowledge in the industry you are breaking into but overall, demonstrating the application of your project, the obstacles you found, and some of the out-of-the-box thinking methods (i.e engineering new and better features based off existing features to better categorize your data for increased accuracy*) various models/approaches you tried to overcome the problem statements and then the insights for that sort of value then you are golden my friend üôè


* One of the projects I worked on involved building a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. Simple stuff right and people would roll their eyes on this one ;) The goal was to incorporate a wide range of features that could influence the price, including factors like square footage, the number of bedrooms/ bathrooms, floors, and many others. In total, the dataset consisted of approximately 63 features, covering every conceivable attribute of a house.

During the data exploration phase, I noticed that one particular feature ‚Äì the age of the house ‚Äì seemed to have a significant impact on the model‚Äôs performance. This observation prompted me to dig deeper, and after conducting extensive research, I discovered an interesting legal aspect related to the geography of the houses I was analyzing.

Specifically, I found that in that particular region, any house older than 120 years was classified as a heritage site as per the law, which afforded it protection and often led to a higher valuation. This insight revealed that these heritage houses were consistently overvalued compared to non-heritage properties of similar characteristics and talking about this diagnostic to explain the why really did wonders in my presentation.

Realizing the importance of this factor, I engineered a new feature specifically to identify heritage houses within the dataset. Incorporating this feature into the model really improved its accuracy. So hopefully this all gives you an idea my friend",118,1744058150.0

With 1 year of experience, I wouldn‚Äôt expect groundbreaking research or deep stacks of production ML. What I‚Äôd actually love to see is:

üîπ **End-to-end thinking.**  
You saw a problem, explored the data, built something useful (even if small), and made a recommendation or shipped it.

üîπ **Clarity > Complexity.**  
Clean code, clean narrative. If you can walk me through your choices clearly, that‚Äôs more impressive than 20 features and 5 models you barely understand.

üîπ **Curiosity.**  
Did you go beyond the notebook? Try something experimental? Challenge assumptions? Use a tool like SHAP to explain something? These things stand out.

üîπ **Business awareness.**  
Even if it‚Äôs a side project, tell me *why* it mattered. Bonus points if you measured outcomes (even hypothetically).

Tbh, I'd rather see **2‚Äì3 tight, real-ish projects** than a huge GitHub of messy notebooks.

Also, don‚Äôt sleep on competitions like [CrunchDAO](https://hub.crunchdao.com/competitions/datacrunch#quickstarter-notebook) or Kaggle. They‚Äôre a great way to show you can work with structured data under real constraints, even without a big-name company on your resume.

mlyw3od,1ju139m,AccomplishedTwist475,"Stay the hell out of it. 

I work in the finance department. Corporate accounting and financial reporting to be specific. I have a decent understanding of Advanced Excel, VBA scripting, Macros, PowerBI and learning Python, SQL etc. Even myself trying to escape finance department and make a career change to data analytics or data science. I work very closely with FPMs, the controller and other leaders in the organization. 

FP&A, accounting, Treasury aka the whole finance department is a very old fashioned and regulated profession. It could be very boring and countless long hours. Nowadays this profession is modernizing a bit with newer ERPs such as Oracle NetSuite, Fusion, SAP, Workday etc. and leveraging data analytics tools such as PowrBI tableau, SQL database but overall it could be very tedious, boring and feel outdated. 

If you have a good understanding of general ledger, trial balance, balance sheet, P&L, budgeting & forecasting, cashflow etc. and like to jump back into the domain then this is completely a personal choice but I wouldn't do it. I would say you have to consider the pros and cons. 

- The finance department is considered a cost center and most employees are underpaid if you compare it to other departments. 

- Burnout is a real thing in the finance department. Many people would like to get out of this department . We often talk about how little we get paid considering amount of long hours we put in. We compare ourselves with other departments and we say literally we make peanuts 

-  There are endless processes and controls because it's a regulated profession

- oftentimes you feel outdated as you are not connected to the technology world and your world revolves around financial data

- Finance department is old fashioned but some level of job security is there 

- If you are good with ML, Deep learning then I'm not sure how much of it you will use in your finance job.

- please do research on Pay Scale as it will be a major factor later in career

mn85mod,1ju139m,parthmaul,"I actually went through a very similar transition (and back again), so hopefully this helps.¬†

**Career Trajectory**

If 100% of your scope is truly SQL/BI-driven analysis and forecasting then you might find your other DS skills atrophying unless you supplement with special projects or self-guided learning. For example, you could really lean into the forecasting component of the role and try learning some advanced methods. In practice, this can be difficult to do depending on the demands of your defined scope.

When you say pure DS, if you mean running a product analytics, marketing science, and/or ML-focused team(s), then I would say this role won‚Äôt necessarily set you up for the next Head of DS/ML position. With that, it won‚Äôt hurt either! I would not view this as a step down and more of a pivot to a role closer to the business. Careers are nonlinear, and I do think you‚Äôll gain really valuable experience taking on this new position. I know I personally did. (Just my two cents, the title is definitely nice, but in the long arc of your career, will probably not matter)

Interestingly, this role could set you up for roles outside of DS, e.g. senior finance leadership, GM, head of \_insert\_functional\_area\_here. Ultimately, it depends on what you want next from your career. Something to consider reflecting on is ‚Äúwhat job do I want two jobs from now?‚Äù If this role sets you up for whatever the answer to that question is, then it could be worth considering!¬†

**Technical Depth vs. Seniority**¬†

Broadly yes; as you move towards these more senior positions, technical depth does not matter as much as DS/ML conceptual understanding, relationship management, strategic thinking, leadership, etc etc

**Compensation Outlook**¬†

My honest take here‚Ä¶ title for title, DS/ML leadership roles pay way more.¬†

Leadership is a good way to see how data flows in your org and design the practical and theoretical pipeline though it is tough to go back to technical thats not necessessarily a bad thing. I dont think there is anything wrong with switching from technical to leadership, just make sure to make time for technical practice and be in charge of your own education.

Its somewhat difficult to be a uniquely contributing IC because systems are designed to turn technical talent into replaceable input out put parts but leadership is something that you can develop in different ways and make an individual mark.
