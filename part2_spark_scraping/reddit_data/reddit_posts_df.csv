I posted a little bit about my current job situation in a previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1javfus/do\_you\_deal\_with\_unrealistic\_expectations\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1javfus/do_you_deal_with_unrealistic_expectations_from/)

Ever since the year started, I've just been looped into tasks where I have no context what it's supposed to do, don't have the requirements clear, frequently have my boss try to get something out without clear requirements and then us fixing it after the fact with another co-worker constantly expressing dissapointment and frustration for things not churning out sooner.

For the past month, I've been working several 12-14 hour shifts. On days when I don't have quick turnaround times, I've noticed myself losing focus, losing interest in the work overall. I signed up for a bunch of Udemy classes in the beginning of the year and feel like my headspace isn't there to upskill even though I had a lot of enthusiasm before. 

Has anybody gone through this situation and have advice? I want to change my job eventually in a few months, but I want to spend time preparing rather than just jump ship at the moment, esp in this market. ",thro0away12,1745518614.0,25,12,0.84,text

My end goal is to become a Data Scientist, ideally specializing in time-series forecasting or recommendation systems. I plan to go straight into a Master’s in Data Science after undergrad.

Today, I just got an offer for a Business Analyst Internship. The role focuses heavily on SQL and Power BI, but doesn’t involve any Python, machine learning, or advanced statistics. It’s a great opportunity and I’d be working with a Business Analytics team at a credit union, but I’m a bit torn.

Will having “Business Analyst Intern” on my resume make me look less competitive for future data science internships or full-time roles—especially compared to students who land internships with “Data Scientist” or “Data Science Intern” in the title?

1k4geso,Ever met a person you think lied about working in Data Science?,"You ever get the feeling someone online or in-person just straight up lied to you about having a Data Science job (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.)?

I was recently talking to someone at a technical meet-up for working professionals and one person was saying some really weird stuff. It was like they had heard of the technical terms before, but didn't actually have the experience working with the technologies/skills. For example, they mentioned that they had ""All sorts of experience with Kafka"" but didn't know that it is a tool that Data Engineers and related professionals could use for their workflows. They also mixed up the definitions of common machine learning models, what said models could do for a business, NoSQL & SQL, etc. It was jarring.

Also, sometimes I get the impression that a minority of people on this subreddit come on and lie about ever having a Data Science job. The more obvious examples are those who post the Chat-GPT answers to post questions. No shade thrown to anyone here. I encounter many qualified people here and have learned new stuff just reading through posts.

Any of you ever had an experience like that?

**Edit:** Hello all. Thank you for all of the responses on this post. I have gotten some good perspective, some hilarious comments, and some cool advice. I appreciate all of you on this sub-reddit.

I do want to say that I do not believe that all Data Scientists need to know Kafka (or any other specific tech. I don't know a bunch of stuff). I brought up the Kafka example because it was the most egregious (the person claimed to have all these years of experience, but didn't know a bunch of stuff including the basics). The conversation was 35 minutes, so I only wanted to bring up the outliers/notable examples.

And I want to emphasize that I was talking about **all** Data Science jobs (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.). Because I think that these are all valid roles and that we all have unique experiences, skills, and knowledge to bring to this field.

1k3nxj7,"Pandas, why the hype?","I'm an R user and I'm at the point where I'm not really improving my programming skills all that much, so I finally decided to learn Python in earnest. I've put together a few projects that combine general programming, ML implementation, and basic data analysis. And overall, I quite like python and it really hasn't been too difficult to pick up. And the few times I've run into an issue, I've generally blamed it on R (e.g . the day I learned about mutable objects was a frustrating one). However, basic analysis - like summary stats - feels impossible.

All this time I've heard Python users hype up pandas. But now that I am actually learning it, I can't help think why? Simple aggregations and other tasks require so much code. But more confusng is the syntax, which seems to be odds with itself at times.  Sometimes we put the column name in the parentheses of a function, other times be but the column name in brackets before the function. Sometimes we call the function normally (e.g.mean()), other times it is contain by quotations. The whole thing reminds me of the Angostura bitters bottle story, where one of the brothers designed the bottles and the other designed the label without talking to one another.

Anyway, this wasn't really meant to be a rant. I'm sticking with it, but does it get better? Should I look at polars instead?

These examples would help me make sure that passing objects from and between the two languages can be as seamless as possible.

1k33k6t,Finally releasing the Bambu Timelapse Dataset – open video data for print‑failure ML (sorry for the delay!),"Hey everyone!

I know it’s been a **long minute** since my original call‑for‑clips – life got hectic and the project had to sit on the back burner a bit longer than I’d hoped. 😅 Thanks for bearing with me!

# What’s new?

* **The dataset is live** on Hugging Face and ready for download or contribution.
* **First models are on the way** (starting with **build‑plate identification**) – but I can’t promise an exact release timeline yet. Life still throws curveballs!

🔗 **Dataset page:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/v2thegreat/bambu-timelapse-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/v2thegreat/bambu-timelapse-dataset)

# What’s inside?

* **627 timelapse videos** from P1/X1 printers
* **81 full‑length camera recordings** straight off the printer cam
* Thumbnails + CSV metadata for quick indexing
* CC‑BY‑4.0 license – free for hobby, research, and even commercial use with proper attribution

# Why bother?

* It’s the **first fully open corpus** of Bambu timelapses; most prior failure‑detection work never shares raw data.
* Bambu Lab printers are everywhere, so the footage mirrors real‑world conditions.
* Great sandbox for manufacturing / QA projects—failure classification, anomaly detection, build‑plate detection, and more.

# Contribute your clips

1. Open a **Pull Request** on the repo (`originals/timelapses/<your_id>/`).
2. If PRs aren’t your jam, DM me and we’ll arrange a transfer link.
3. Please crop or blur anything private; aim for bed‑only views.

# Skill level

If you know some Python and basic ML, this is a perfect **intermediate** project to dive into computer vision. Total beginners can still poke around with the sample code, but training solid models will take a bit of experience.

Thanks again for everyone’s patience and for the clips already shared—can’t wait to see what the community builds with this!",v2thegreat,1745089085.0,19,5,0.96,text
1k2igce,What SWE/AI Engineer skills in 2025 can I learn to complement Data Science?,"At my company currently - the hype is to use LLMs and GenAI at every intersection.

I have seen this means that a lot of DS work is now instead handed to SWEs, and the 'modelling' is all a GPT/API call.

Maybe this is just a feature of my company and the way they look at their tech stack, but I feel that DS is not getting as many projects and things are going to the SWEs only, as they can quickly build, and rapidly deploy into product.

I want to better learn how to integrate GenAI features/apps in our JavaScript based product, so that I can also build and integrate, and build working PoCs, rather than being trapped in notebooks. 

I'm not sure if I should just learn raw JS, because I'd even want to know how to put things into a silent test as an example, where predictions are made but no prediction is shown to the user.

1k2u4nd,Leverage Points for a Design Matrix with Mainly Categorial Features,"Hello! I hope this is a stupid question and gets quickly resolved. As per title, I have a design matrix with a high amount of categorial features. I am applying a linear regression model on the data set (mainly for training myself to get familiarity with linear regression). The model has a high amount of categorial features that I have one-hot encoded.

Now I try to figure out high leverage points for the design matrix. After a couple of attempts I was wondering if that would even make sense and how to evaluate if determining high leverage points would generally make sense in this scenario.

After asking ChatGPT (which provided a weird answer I know is incorrect) and searching a bit I found nothing explaining this. So, I thought I come here and ask:

* In how far does it make sense to compute/check for leverage values given that there is a high amount of categorial features?
* How to compute them? Would I use the diagonal of the HAT matrix or is there eventually another technique?

None of the skills or achievements there are noteworthy : no model building, no big analyses, no data engineering or Gen ai work, just model validation work (helping other people fix their modeling solutions).

At most I can extend the fellowship for one additional year. It sounds exciting. It pays 10K less, but it’s a step in the right direction. It gets me closer to what I actually studied.

The reason I write this post is because I want to know if it will negatively impact my resume or future chances. If I take this job, my resume will look like this : data analyst job (3 years) with a bit of sql and excel, two data science internships (one 3 months and one 8 months) at the university, quantitative analyst (6months), data engineer fellowship (1 year). Will this make companies look at me like a problem and not give me a chance to even interview? Thanks in advance, everybody.

Since my background is data engineering, how can I learn data science in a structured bottom up manner so that I can best understand what exactly the data scientists want? 

This may sound like overkill to some but so far the data scientist I’m working with is trying to build a data science model that requires enriched historical data for the training of the data science model. Ok no problem so far. 

However, they then want to run the data science model on the data as it’s collected (before enrichment) but the problem is this data science model is trained on enriched historical data that wont have the exact same schema as the data that’s being collected real time?

What’s even more confusing is some data scientists have said this is ok and some said it isn’t.

I don’t know which person is right. So, I’d rather learn at least the basics, preferably through some good books & projects so that I can understand when the data scientists are asking for something unreasonable.

I need to be able to easily speak the language of data scientists so I can provide better support and let them know when there’s an issue with the data that may effect their data science model in unexpected ways. ",khaili109,1744848145.0,65,33,0.93,text

1k0vdku,Quick question regarding nested resampling and model selection workflow,"EDIT!!!!!! Post wording is confusing, when I refer to models I mean one singular model tuned N number of ways. E.g. random Forrest tuned to 4 different depths would be model a,b,c,d in my diagram.

Just wanted some feedback regarding my model selection approach.

The premise:  
Need to train dev a model and I will need to perform nested resmapling to prevent against spatial and temporal leakage.  
Outer samples will handle spatial leakage.  
Inner samples will handle temporal leakage.  
I will also be tuning a model.

Via the diagram below, my model tuning and selection will be as follows:  
\-Make inital 70/30 data budget  
\-Perfrom some number of spatial resamples (4 shown here)  
\-For each spatial resample (1-4), I will make N (4 shown) spatial splits  
\-For each inner time sample i will train and test N (4 shown) models and mark their perfromance  
\-For each outer samples' inner samples - one winner model will be selected based on some criteria  
\--e.g Model A out performs all models trained innner samples 1-4 for outer sample #1  
\----Outer/spatial #1 -- winner model A  
\----Outer/spatial #2 -- winner model D  
\----Outer/spatial #3 -- winner model C  
\----Outer/spatial #4 -- winner model A  
\-I take each winner from the previous step and train them on their entire train sets and validate on their test sets  
\--e.g train model A on outer #1 train and test on outer #1 test  
\----- train model D on outer #2 train and test on outer #2 test  
\----- and so on  
\-From this step the model the perfroms the best is then selected from these 4 and then trained on the entire inital 70% train and evalauated on the inital 30% holdout.

Should I change my method up at all?  
I was thinking that I might be adding bias in to the second modeling step (training the winning models on the outer/spatial samples) because there could be differences in the spatial samples themselves.   
Potentially some really bad data ends up exclusively in the test set for one of the outer folds and by default make one of the models not be selected that otherwise might have.

1jxl18x,Ace The Interview - SQL Intuitively and Exhaustively Explained,"SQL is easy to learn and hard to master. Realistically, the difficulty of the questions you get will largely be dictated by the job role you're trying to fill.

From it's highest level, SQL is a ""declarative language"", meaning it doesn't define a set of operations, but rather a desired end result. This can make SQL incredibly expressive, but also a bit counterintuitive, especially if you aren't fully aware of it's declarative nature.

SQL expressions are passed through an SQL engine, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. Thes engines parse out your SQL expressions, optimize them, and turn them into an actual list of steps to get the data you want. While not as often discussed, for beginners I recommend SQLite. It's easy to set up in virtually any environment, and allows you to get rocking with SQL quickly. If you're working in big data, I recommend also brushing up on something like PostgreSQL, but the differences are not so bad once you have a solid SQL understanding.

In being a high level declaration, SQL’s grammatical structure is, fittingly, fairly high level. It’s kind of a weird, super rigid version of English. SQL queries are largely made up of:

* **Keywords:** special words in SQL that tell an engine what to do. Some common ones, which we’ll discuss, are `SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY` . They can be lowercase or uppercase, but usually they’re written in uppercase.
* **Identifiers:** Identifiers are the names of database objects like tables, columns, etc.
* **Literals:** numbers, text, and other hardcoded values
* **Operators:** Special characters or keywords used in comparison and arithmetic operations. For example `!=`, `<` ,`OR`, `NOT` , `*`, `/`, `%` , `IN`, `LIKE` . We’ll cover these later.
* **Clauses:** These are the major building block of SQL, and can be stitched together to combine a queries general behavior. They usually start with a keyword, like 
   * `SELECT` – defines which columns to return 
   * `FROM` – defines the source table 
   * `WHERE` – filters rows 
   * `GROUP BY` – groups rows etc.  

By combining these clauses, you create an SQL query

There are a ton of things you can do in SQL, like create tables:

    CREATE TABLE People(first_name, last_name, age, favorite_color)

Insert data into tables:

    INSERT INTO People
    VALUES
        ('Tom', 'Sawyer', 19, 'White'),
        ('Mel', 'Gibson', 69, 'Green'),
        ('Daniel', 'Warfiled', 27, 'Yellow')

Select certain data from tables:

    SELECT first_name, favorite_color FROM People

Search based on some filter

    SELECT * FROM People WHERE id = 3

And Delete Data

    DELETE FROM People WHERE age < 30 

What was previously mentioned makes up the cornerstone of pretty much all of SQL. Everything else builds on it, and there is a lot.

**Primary and Foreign Keys**  
A *primary key* is a unique identifier for each record in a table. A *foreign key* references a primary key in another table, allowing you to relate data across tables. This is the backbone of relational database design.

**Super Keys and Composite Keys**  
A *super key* is any combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row. When a unique combination requires multiple columns, it’s often called a *composite key* — useful in complex schemas like logs or transactions.

**Normalization and Database Design**  
Normalization is the process of splitting data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy. First Normal Form (1NF) ensures atomic rows, Second Normal Form (2NF) separates logically distinct data, and Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates derived data stored in the same table.

**Creating Relational Schemas in SQLite**  
You can explicitly define tables with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints using `CREATE TABLE`. These relationships enforce referential integrity and enable behaviors like cascading deletes. SQLite enforces `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints strictly, making your schema more robust.

**Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**  
ERDs visually represent tables and their relationships. Dotted lines and cardinality markers like `{0,1}` or `0..N` indicate how many records in one table relate to another, which helps document and debug schema logic.

**JOINs**  
JOIN operations combine rows from multiple tables using foreign keys. `INNER JOIN` includes only matched rows, `LEFT JOIN` includes all from the left table, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (emulated in SQLite) combines both. Proper JOINs are critical for data integration.

**Filtering and LEFT/RIGHT JOIN Differences**  
JOIN order affects which rows are preserved when there’s no match. For example, using `LEFT JOIN` ensures all left-hand rows are kept — useful for identifying unmatched data. SQLite lacks `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can simulate it by flipping the table order in a `LEFT JOIN`.

**Simulating FULL OUTER JOINs**  
SQLite doesn’t support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but you can emulate it with a `UNION` of two `LEFT JOIN` queries and a `WHERE` clause to catch nulls from both sides. This approach ensures no records are lost in either table.

**The WHERE Clause and Filtration**  
`WHERE` filters records based on conditions, supporting logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), numeric comparisons, and string operations like `LIKE`, `IN`, and `REGEXP`. It's one of the most frequently used clauses in SQL.

**DISTINCT Selections**  
Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique values from a column. You can also select distinct combinations of columns (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT name, grade`) to avoid duplicate rows in the result.

**Grouping and Aggregation Functions**  
With `GROUP BY`, you can compute metrics like `AVG`, `SUM`, or `COUNT` for each group. `HAVING` lets you filter grouped results, like showing only departments with an average salary above a threshold.

**Ordering and Limiting Results**  
`ORDER BY` sorts results by one or more columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, and `OFFSET` lets you skip rows — useful for pagination or ranked listings.

**Updating and Deleting Data**  
`UPDATE` modifies existing rows using `SET`, while `DELETE` removes rows based on `WHERE` filters. These operations can be combined with other clauses to selectively change or clean up data.

**Handling NULLs**  
`NULL` represents missing or undefined values. You can detect them using `IS NULL` or replace them with defaults using `COALESCE`. Aggregates like `AVG(column)` ignore NULLs by default, while `COUNT(*)` includes all rows.

**Subqueries**  
Subqueries are nested `SELECT` statements used inside `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT`. They’re useful for filtering by aggregates, comparisons, or generating intermediate results for more complex logic.

**Correlated Subqueries**  
These are subqueries that reference columns from the outer query. Each row in the outer query is matched against a custom condition in the subquery — powerful but often inefficient unless optimized.

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
CTEs let you define temporary named result sets with `WITH`. They make complex queries readable by breaking them into logical steps and can be used multiple times within the same query.

**Recursive CTEs**  
Recursive CTEs solve hierarchical problems like org charts or category trees. A base case defines the start, and a recursive step extends the output until no new rows are added. Useful for generating sequences or computing reporting chains.

**Window Functions**  
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Examples include `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER ()`, and moving averages with sliding windows.

These all can be combined together to do a lot of different stuff.

In my opinion, this is too much to learn efficiently learn outright. It requires practice and the slow aggregation of concepts over many projects. If you're new to SQL, I recommend studying the basics and learning through doing. However, if you're on the job hunt and you need to cram, you might find this breakdown useful: [https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively](https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively)",Daniel-Warfield,1744474855.0,217,14,0.88,text

1jxdlfg,Marketing Mix Models - are they really a good idea?,"hi,

I've seen a prior thread on this, but my question is more technical...

A prior company got sold a Return on Marketing Invest project by one of the big 4 consultancies.  The basis of it was build a bunch of MMMs, pump the budget in, and it automatically tells what you where to spend the budget to get the most bang for you buck.  Sounds wonderful.

I was the DS shadowing the consultancy to learn the models, so we could do a refresh.  The company had an annual marketing budget of 250m€ and its revenue was between 1.5 and 2bn €.

Once I got into doing the refresh, I really felt the process was never going to succeed.  Marketing thought ""there's 3 years of data, we must have a good model"", but in reality 3\*52 weeks is a tiny amount of data, when you try to fit in TV, Radio, Press, OOH, Whitemail, Email, Search, Social, and then include prices from you and comp, and seasonal variables.

You need to adstock each media to take affect for lags - and finding the level of adstock requires experimentation. The 156 weeks need to have a test and possibly a validation set given the experiments.

The business is then interested in things like what happens when we do TV and OOH together, which means creating combined variables.  More variables on very little data.

I am a practical Data Scientist.  I don't get hung up on the technical details and am focused on generating value, but this whole process seemed a crazy and expensive waste of time.  

The positive that came out of it was that we started doing AB testing in certain areas where the initial models suggested there was very low return, and those areas had previously been very resistant to any kind of testing.  

This feels a bit like a rant, but I'm genuinely interested if people think it can work.  It feels like its a over promising in the worst way.",SonicBoom_81,1744450729.0,112,49,0.94,text

1jwbevk,What technical skills should young data scientists be learning?,"Data science is obviously a broad and ill-defined term, but most DS jobs today fall into one of the following flavors:

- Data analysis (a/b testing, causal inference, experimental design)

- Traditional ML (supervised learning, forecasting, clustering) 

- Data engineering (ETL, cloud development, model monitoring, data modeling)

- Applied Science (Deep learning, optimization, Bayesian methods, recommender systems, typically more advanced and niche, requiring doctoral education)

The notion of a “full stack” data scientist has declined in popularity, and it seems that many entrants into the field need to decide one of the aforementioned areas to specialize in to build a career. 

For instance, a seasoned product DS will be the best candidate for senior product DS roles, but not so much for senior data engineering roles, and vice versa. 

Since I find learning and specializing in everything to be infeasible, I am interested in figuring out which of these “paths” will equip one with the most employable skillset, especially given how fast “AI” is changing the landscape. 

For instance, when I talk to my product DS friends, they advise to learn how to develop software and use cloud platforms since it is essential in the age of big data, even though they rarely do this on the job themselves. 

My data engineer friends on the other hand say that data engineering tools are easy to learn, change too often, and are becoming increasingly abstracted, making developing a strong product/business sense a wiser choice. 

Is either group right? 

Am I overthinking and would be better off just following whichever path interests me most? 

EDIT: I think the essence of my question was to assume that candidates have solid business knowledge. Given this, which skillset is more likely to survive in today and tomorrow’s job market given AI advancements and market conditions. Saying all or multiple pathways will remain important is also an acceptable answer. ",etherealcabbage72,1744326138.0,387,75,0.97,text

# The position bias in LLMs is the root cause of the problem

I've been working with LlamaIndex's AgentWorkflow framework - a promising multi-agent orchestration system that lets different specialized AI agents hand off tasks to each other. But there's been one frustrating issue: when Agent A hands off to Agent B, Agent B often fails to continue processing the user's original request, forcing users to repeat themselves.

This breaks the natural flow of conversation and creates a poor user experience. Imagine asking for research help, having an agent gather sources and notes, then when it hands off to the writing agent - silence. You have to ask your question again!

[The receiving agent doesn't immediately respond to the user's latest request - the user has to repeat their question.](https://preview.redd.it/ucl76xnmcyte1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc975569f3bda5238ebb5ed1e5b08ff7cc86049)

**Why This Happens: The Position Bias Problem**

After investigating, I discovered this stems from how large language models (LLMs) handle long conversations. They suffer from ""position bias"" - where information at the beginning of a chat gets ""forgotten"" as new messages pile up.

[Different positions in the chat context have different attention weights. Arxiv 2407.01100](https://preview.redd.it/ugtqdq2tdyte1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9978aef461521633c8e20786ed48d8a106a2de)

In AgentWorkflow:

1. User requests go into a memory queue first
2. Each tool call adds 2+ messages (call + result)
3. The original request gets pushed deeper into history
4. By handoff time, it's either buried or evicted due to token limits

[FunctionAgent puts both tool\_call and tool\_call\_result info into ChatMemory, which pushes user requests to the back of the queue.](https://preview.redd.it/ypd4caewdyte1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=240629c41c2f581dd7c3c8917912827358db5525)

Research shows that in an 8k token context window, information in the first 10% of positions can lose over 60% of its influence weight. The LLM essentially ""forgets"" the original request amid all the tool call chatter.

**Failed Attempts**

First, I tried the developer-suggested approach - modifying the handoff prompt to include the original request. This helped the receiving agent see the request, but it still lacked context about previous steps.

[The original handoff implementation didn't include user request information.](https://preview.redd.it/lbnm2laxcyte1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=261eb162385f7f471c92a7812c188404ed682548)

[The output of the updated handoff now includes both chat history review and user request information.](https://preview.redd.it/u5eukjkycyte1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=2956e9aa2f88ce7aa65da0f09fbdb93a7930aa27)

Next, I tried reinserting the original request after handoff. This worked better - the agent responded - but it didn't understand the full history, producing incomplete results.

[After each handoff, I copy the original user request to the queue's end. ](https://preview.redd.it/j5irsta0dyte1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4cbaf58ca093a06938e0ccf9cd7ea9164def92d)

**The Solution: Strategic Memory Management**

The breakthrough came when I realized we needed to work with the LLM's natural attention patterns rather than against them. My solution:

1. **Clean Chat History**: Only keep actual user messages and agent responses in the conversation flow
2. **Tool Results to System Prompt**: Move all tool call results into the system prompt where they get 3-5x more attention weight
3. **State Management**: Use the framework's state system to preserve critical context between agents

[Attach the tool call result as state info in the system\_prompt.](https://preview.redd.it/yj1wmx06eyte1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=96272c1d5ead65d83881780ae6ee4d92d7c0e7aa)

This approach respects how LLMs actually process information while maintaining all necessary context.

**The Results**

After implementing this:

* Receiving agents immediately continue the conversation
* They have full awareness of previous steps
* The workflow completes naturally without repetition
* Output quality improves significantly

For example, in a research workflow:

1. Search agent finds sources and takes notes
2. Writing agent receives handoff
3. It immediately produces a complete report using all gathered information

[ResearchAgent not only continues processing the user request but fully perceives the search notes, ultimately producing a perfect research report.](https://preview.redd.it/1hw8vza8dyte1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=b721645671c5639c2e0b7990395ed077a992900f)

**Why This Matters**

Understanding position bias isn't just about fixing this specific issue - it's crucial for anyone building LLM applications. These principles apply to:

* All multi-agent systems
* Complex workflows
* Any application with extended conversations

The key lesson: LLMs don't treat all context equally. Design your memory systems accordingly.

[In different LLMs, the positions where the model focuses on important info don't always match the actual important info spots. ](https://preview.redd.it/ex69ri8cdyte1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=d680659f6e9889775c4d24b650e06ac9791945df)

1jvwexo,Do professionals in the industry still refer to online sources or old code for solutions?,"Hey everyone,  
I’m currently studying and working on improving my skills in data science, and I’ve been wondering something:

Do professionals—those already working in the industry—still take reference from online sources like Stack Overflow, old GitHub repos, documentation, or even their previous Jupyter notebooks when they’re coding?

Sometimes I feel like I’m “cheating” when I google things I forgot or reuse snippets from old work. But is this actually a normal part of professional workflows?

For example, take this small code block below:

  
`# 1. Instantiate the random forest classifier`

`rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)`



`# 2. Create a dictionary of hyperparameters to tune`

`cv_params = {'max_depth': [None],`

`'max_features': [1.0],`

`'max_samples': [1.0],`

`'min_samples_leaf': [2],`

`'min_samples_split': [2],`

`'n_estimators': [300],`

`}`



`# 3. Define a list of scoring metrics to capture`

`scoring = ['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'f1']`



`# 4. Instantiate the GridSearchCV object`

`rf_cv = GridSearchCV(rf, cv_params, scoring=scoring, cv=4, refit='recall')`

1juzclh,Familiar matchmaking in gaming; to match players with players they like and have played with before,"I've seen the classic MMRs before based on skill level in many different games. 

But the truth is gaming is about fun, and playing with people you already like or who are similar to people you like is a massive fun multiplier

So the challenge is how would you design a method to achieve that? Multiple algorithms, or something simpler?  
  
My initial idea is raw, and ripe for improvement

During or after a game session is over you get to thumbs up or thumbs down players you enjoyed playing with. 

Later on if you are in a matchmaking queue the list of players you've thumbed up is consulted and the party that has players with the greatest total thumbs up points at the top of that list gets matched to your party if there is free space, and if you are at the top of the available people on their end too.

The end goal here is to make public matchmaking more fun, and feel more familiar as you get to play repeatedly with players you've enjoyed playing with before.

The main issue with this type of matchmaking is that over time it would be difficult for newer players to get enough thumbs up to get higher on the list. Harder to get to play with the people who already have a large pool of people they like to play with. I don't know how to solve that issue at the moment.",wang-bang,1744180578.0,23,7,0.95,text

1ju139m,Career Crossroads: DS Manager (Retail) w/ Finance Background -> Head of Finance Analytics Offer - Seeking Guidance & Perspectives,"
Hey r/datascience,

Hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here regarding a potential career move. I'd appreciate any insights or perspectives you might have.

My Background:

Current Role: Data Science Manager at a Retail company.

Experience: ~8 years in Data Science (started as IC, now Manager).

Prior Experience: ~5 years in Finance/M&A before transitioning into data science.
The Opportunity:

I have an opportunity for a Head of Finance Analytics role, situated within (or closely supporting) the Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) function.

The Appeal: 
This role feels like a potentially great way to merge my two distinct career paths (Finance + Data Science). It leverages my domain knowledge from both worlds. The ""Head of"" title also suggests significant leadership scope.

The Nature of the Work:
The primary focus will be data analysis using SQL and BI tools to support financial planning and decision-making.
Revenue forecasting is also a key component.
However, it's not a traditional data science role. Expect limited exposure to diverse ML projects or building complex predictive models beyond forecasting.
The tech stack is not particularly advanced (likely more SQL/BI-centric than Python/R ML libraries).


My Concerns / Questions for the Community:

Career Trajectory - Title vs. Substance? 
Moving from a ""Data Science Manager"" to a ""Head of Finance Analytics"" seems like a step up title-wise. However, is shifting focus primarily to SQL/BI-driven analysis and forecasting, away from broader ML/DS projects and advanced techniques, a potential functional downstep or specialization that might limit future pure DS leadership roles?

Technical Depth vs. Seniority: 
As you move towards Head of/Director/VP levels, how critical is maintaining cutting-edge data science technical depth versus deep domain expertise (finance), strategic impact through analysis, and leadership? Does the type of technical work (e.g., complex SQL/BI vs. complex ML) become less defining at these senior levels?

Compensation Outlook: 
What does the compensation landscape typically look like for senior analytics leadership roles like ""Head of Finance Analytics,"" especially within FP&A or finance departments, compared to pure Data Science management/director tracks in tech or other industries? Trying to gauge the long-term financial implications.

I'm essentially weighing the unique opportunity to blend my background and gain a significant leadership title (""Head of"") against the trade-offs in the type of technical work and the potential divergence from a purely data science leadership path.

Has anyone made a similar move or have insights into navigating careers at the intersection of Data Science and Finance/FP&A, particularly in roles heavy on analysis and forecasting? Any perspectives on whether this is a strategic pivot leveraging my unique background or a potential limitation for future high-level DS roles would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

TL;DR: DS Manager (8 YOE DS, 5 YOE Finance) considering ""Head of Finance Analytics"" role. Opportunity to blend background + senior title. Work is mainly SQL/BI analysis + forecasting, less diverse/advanced DS. Worried about technical ""downstep"" vs. pure DS track & long-term compensation. Seeking advice.

I love this quote from Saturday Night Live's creator, Lorne Michaels. It holds a lot of wisdom about how projects should be planned and executed.

In data science, it perfectly captures the idea of shaping a project with fixed time and flexible scope. Too often, we get stuck in PoC hell. When every new project is treated as an experiment, requirements tend to be vague, definitions of done unclear. We fall into the rabbit hole of endlessly tweaking hyperparameters, convinced that the right combination will solve all our problems.

We end up running in circles, with yet another PoC that never makes it to production.

Lorne understood back in 1975 that to make people laugh every Saturday, they had to work with a fixed time and flexible scope. If they’ve managed to do that every week for nearly 50 years, why can't we get a model into production in less than six months?",santiviquez,1744037775.0,0,14,0.46,image

1js1sgj,How to deal with medium data,"I recently had a problem at work that dealt with what I’m coining as “medium” data which is not big data where traditional machine learning greatly helps and it wasn’t small data where you can really only do basic counts and means and medians. What I’m referring to is data that likely has a relationship that can be studied based on expertise but falls short in any sort of regression due to overfitting and not having the true variability based on the understood data.

The way I addressed this was I used elasticity as a predictor. Where I divided the percentage change of each of my inputs by my percentage change of my output which allowed me to calculate this elasticity constant then used that constant to somewhat predict what I would predict the change in output would be since I know what the changes in input would be. I make it very clear to stakeholders that this method should be used with a heavy grain of salt and to understand that this approach is more about seeing the impact across the entire dataset and changing inputs in specific places will have larger effects because a large effect was observed in the past.

So I ask what are some other methods to deal with medium sized data where there is likely a relationship but your ML methods result in overfitting and not being robust enough?

1jqjinm,Ace the Interview: Graphs,"A solid grasp of graph theory can give you an edge in technical interviews, especially when the problem at hand is less about code and more about the structure beneath it.

At their core, graphs are about relationships. Each node represents an entity, and each edge represents a relationship. This simple abstraction lets you model remarkably complex systems. What matters most in interviews is not memorizing jargon, but understanding what these structures mean and how to work with them intuitively.

A graph doesn’t care where things are laid out—it only matters who connects to whom. That’s why there are countless ways to visualize the same graph. This property reminds us that graph algorithms don’t depend on visuals but on connectivity.

You should also get comfortable with the flavors of graphs. Some have direction (like a tweet being retweeted), some allow duplicate edges (multigraphs), and some are fully connected (cliques and complete graphs). Understanding when to use each form lets you frame problems properly, which is half the battle in any interview.

One of the most powerful concepts is the subgraph—a way to isolate parts of a system for focused analysis. It’s useful when troubleshooting a bug, analyzing a subset of users, or designing modular systems.

Key graph metrics like degree, centrality, and shortest path help you quantify structure. They reveal which nodes are “important,” how information flows, and how efficient routes can be. These aren’t just for theory—they appear constantly in ranking algorithms, search engine logic, and network analysis.

And don’t overlook concepts like bridges, which are edges whose removal splits the graph, or graph coloring, which underpins classic scheduling and resource allocation problems. Questions about exam scheduling, register allocation, or task assignment often reduce to “coloring” graphs efficiently.

Ultimately, the interview isn’t testing whether you know the name of every centrality metric. It’s testing whether you can recognize a graph problem when you see one—and whether you can think in terms of connections, constraints, and traversals.

1jq1lwz,select typical 10? select unusual 10? select comprehensive 10?,"Hi group, I'm a data scientist based in New Zealand.

Some years ago I did some academic work on non-random sampling - selecting points that are 'interesting' in some sense from a dataset. I'm now thinking about bringing that work to a wider audience.

I was thinking in terms of implementing as SQL syntax *(although* r/snowflake *suggests it may work better as a stored procedure).* This would enable some powerful exploratory data analysis patterns without stepping out of SQL.

We might propose queries like:

* *select typical 10...* (finds 10 records that are ""average"" or ""normal"" in some sense)
* *select unusual 10...* (finds the 10 records that are most 'different' from the rest of the dataset in some sense)
* *select comprehensive 10...* (finds a group of 10 records that, between them, represent as much as possible of the dataset)
* *select representative 10...* (finds a group of 10 records that, between them, approximate the distribution of the full dataset as closely as possible)

I've implemented a bunch of these 'select-adjectives' in R as a first step. Most of them work off a difference matrix using a generic metric using [Gower's distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gower%27s_distance). For example, 'select unusual 10' finds the ten records with the least RMS distance from all records in the dataset.

For demonstration purposes, I applied these methods to a [test dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/poliscidata/versions/2.3.0/topics/world) of 'countries \[or territories\] of the world' containing various economic and social indicators, and found:

* five *typical* countries are the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Mongolia, Malaysia, Thailand *(generally middle-income, quite democratic countries with moderate social development)*
* the most *unique* countries are Afghanistan, Cuba, Fiji, Botswana, Tunisia and Libya *(none of which is very like any other country)*
* a *comprehensive* list of seven countries, spanning the range of conditions as widely as possible, is Mauritania *(poor, less democratic)*, Cote d'Ivoire *(poor, more democratic)*, Kazakhstan *(middle income, less democratic)*, Dominican Republic *(middle income, more democratic)*, Kuwait *(high income, less democratic)*, Slovenia *(high income, more democratic)*, Germany *(very high income)*
* the six territories that are most *different* from each other are Sweden, the USA, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Palestine and Taiwan
* the six countries that are most *similar* to each other are Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.

*(Please don't be offended if I've mischaracterised a country you love. Please also don't be offended if I've said a region is a country that, in your view, is not a country. The blame doubtless rests with my rather out-of-date test dataset.)*

1jobolz,Tired of AI,"One of the reasons I wanted to become an AI engineer was because I wanted to do cool and artsy stuff in my free time and automate away the menial tasks. But with the continuous advancements I am finding that it is taking away the fun in doing stuff. The sense of accomplishment I once used to have by doing a task meticulously for 2 hours can now be done by AI in seconds and while it's pretty cool it is also quite demoralising. 

The recent 'ghibli style photo' trend made me wanna vomit, because it's literally nothing but plagiarism and there's nothing novel about it. I used to marvel at the art created by Van Gogh or Picasso and always tried to analyse the thought process that might have gone through their minds when creating such pieces as the Starry night (so much so that it was one of the first style transfer project I did when learning Machine Learning). But the images now generated while fun seems soulless.

And the hypocrisy of us using AI for such useless things. Oh my god. It boils my blood thinking about how much energy is being wasted to do some of the stupid stuff via AI, all the while there is continuously increasing energy shortage throughout the world.

And the amount of job shortage we are going to have in the near future is going to be insane! Because not only is AI coming for software development, art generation, music composition, etc. It is also going to expedite the already flourishing robotics industry. Case in point look at all the agentic, MCP and self prompting techniques that have come out in the last 6 months itself.

I know that no one can stop progress, and neither should we, but sometimes I dread to imagine the future for not only people like me but the next generation itself. Are we going to need a universal basic income? How is innovation going to be shaped in the future? 

Apologies for the rant and being a downer but needed to share my thoughts somewhere.

1jnh32k,Why you should use RMSE over MAE,"I often see people default to using MAE for their regression models, but I think on average most people would be better suited by MSE or RMSE.

Why? Because they are both minimized by different estimates!

You can prove that MSE is minimized by the conditional expectation (mean), so E(Y | X).

But on the other hand, you can prove that MAE is minimized by the conditional median. Which would be Median(Y | X).

It might be tempting to use MAE because it seems more ""explainable"", but you should be asking yourself what you care about more. Do you want to predict the expected value (mean) of your target, or do you want to predict the median value of your target?

I think that in the majority of cases, what people actually want to predict is the expected value, so we should default to MSE as our choice of loss function for training or hyperparameter searches, evaluating models, etc.

EDIT: Just to be clear, business objectives always come first, and the business objective should be what determines the quantity you want to predict and, therefore, the loss function you should choose.

Lastly, this should be the final optimization metric that you use to evaluate your models. But that doesn't mean you can't report on other metrics to stakeholders, and it doesn't mean you can't use a modified loss function for training.",Ty4Readin,1743354336.0,93,119,0.85,text

Has anyone here faced a similar decision? Did learning another language significantly boost your career, or was it just a nice-to-have skill? Or maybe this is just a waste of time?

1jlnhg1,"“Good at practical ML, weak on theory” — getting the same feedback everywhere. How do I fix this?","Recently got this feedback after a machine learning engineer interview:

“You clearly understand how to make ML algorithms work in practice and have solid experience with real-world projects. But your explanations of the theoretical concepts behind the algorithms were vague or imprecise. We recommend taking a few months to review the fundamentals before reapplying.”

This isn’t the first time I’ve heard this — in fact, it’s a pattern I’m seeing across multiple interviews with tech-focused companies. And it’s getting in the way of landing the kinds of roles I’m really interested in.

Some context:
I’ve been working for 2–3 years as an ML engineer at a large non-tech company. My experience is pretty diverse — from traditional supervised learning to computer vision, with a recent shift toward GenAI (LLMs, embeddings, prompting, RAG, etc.). I’ve built end-to-end pipelines, deployed models, and shipped ML to production. But because the work is so applied — and lately very GenAI-oriented — I’ve honestly drifted away from the theoretical side of ML.

Now I’m trying to move into roles at more ML-mature companies, and I’m getting stuck at the theory part of the interviews.

My question is: how would you recommend brushing up on ML theory in a structured, deep way — after being in the field for a while?
I’m not starting from zero, but I clearly need to tighten up my understanding and explanations.

Would love any advice, resources, or even personal stories from others who made the leap from applied/practical ML to more theory-heavy roles.

1jl1ldy,Leaving data science - what are my options?,"This doesn't seem to be within the scope of the transitioning thread, so asking in my own post.

I have 10 YoE and am in the US. Was laid off in January. Was an actuarial analyst back in 2015 (I have four exams passed) using VBA and Excel, worked my way up to data analyst doing SQL + dashboarding (Shiny, Tableau, Power BI, D3), statistician using R and SQL and Python, and ended up at a lead DS. Minus things like Qlik, Databricks, Spark, and Snowflake, I have probably used that technology in a professional setting (yes, I have used all three major cloud services). I have a MS in statistics (my thesis was on time series) and am currently enrolled in OMSCS, but I am considering ending my enrollment there after having taken CV, DL, and RL.

I am very disappointed by how I observe the field has changed since ChatGPT came out. In the jobs I have had since that time as well as with interviews, the general impression I get is that people expect models to do both causal discovery and prediction optimally through mere data ingestion and algorithmic processing, without any sort of thought as to what data are available, what research questions there are, and for what purpose we are doing modeling. I did not enter this field to become a software engineer and just watch the process get automated away due to others' expectations of how models work only to find that expectations don't match reality. And then aside from that, I want nothing to do with generative AI. That is a whole other can of worms I won't get into. 

Very long story short, due to my mental health and due to me pushing through GenAI hype for job security, I did end up losing my memory in the process. I'm taking good care of myself (as mentioned in the comments, I've been 21 weeks into therapy). But I'm at a point right now where I'm not willing to just take any job without recognizing my mental limits. 

I am looking for data roles tied to actual business operations that have some aspect of requirements gathering (analyst, engineering, scientist, manager roles that aren't screaming AI all over them) and statistician roles, but especially given the layoff situation with the federal employees and contractors as well as entry-level saturation, this seems to be an uphill battle. I also think I'm in a situation where I have too much experience for an IC role and too little for a managerial role. The most extreme option I am considering is just dropping everything to become an electrician or HVAC person (not like I'm particularly attached to due to my memory loss anyway).

I want to ask this community for two things: suggestions for other things to pursue, and how to tailor my resume given the current situation. I have paid for a resume service and I've had my resume reviewed by tons of people. I have done a ton of networking. I just don't think that my mindset is right for this field.

3) Because of this observation window can have overlap from one time point to another.

For example we do treatment day 2 had an immediate effect. We the treatment window of 7 days wont be viable.  
Day 1 will always have treatment day 2 maybe or maybe not.  My main issue is reverse causality.

Am i the only one that thinks training a llama3 model for this task is overkill as hell?

I understand the chatgpt approach because it's very simple to implement, but the costs are going to add up as well since there will be quite a lot of input tokens. My approach can run in a lambda and be trained locally.

**Also, I should add: for 80% of meetings we get the true labels out of meetings metadata, so we wouldn't need to run any model. Even if my tf-idf model was 10% worse than the llama3 approach, the real difference would really only be 2%, hence why I think this is good enough...**",AdministrativeRub484,1743015938.0,95,66,0.94,text

Initial requirements gathering and research in a markdown document or confluence page. 

ETL, EDA in one or more notebooks with inline markdown documentation.

Solution/model candidate design back in confluence/markdown.

And onward to model experimentation, iteration, deployment, documenting as we go.


I feel like I’m at the point where my approach to the planning/design portions are bottlenecking my efficiency, particularly for managing complex projects. In particular:

- I haven’t found a satisfactory diagramming tool. I bounce around between mermaid diagrams and drawing in powerpoint.

- Braindumping in a markdown document feels natural, but I suspect I can be more efficient than just starting with a blank canvas and hammering away.

I’ve been applying to on-site roles for about a month now to get my foot in the door. Anything “data adjacent” or a large company where I think I can do (hopefully) an internal transfer. I’ll be leaving a remote (niche role). I just got contacted for an interview for an “Analyst” position at an insurance company. It pays almost $10,000 less than I get paid now and it’s hybrid. 

It’s not really an analyst role but I’ll be analyzing insurance applications, learn the proper classifications, and pricing. It’s more of clerical role. They do have a data analyst team, and based on my limited research on LinkedIn, many of them start off in the “Analyst” role and then pivot internally to a Data Analyst. They don’t expect you to have experience in insurance and are willing to completely train you. They also have great benefits as well. 

Would accepting this role be good for me? I know I’ll be making much less because I’m now going to be hybrid and making almost $10,000 less but this is the best I can do.

I'm about to start my Master’s thesis in DS, and I’m planning to focus on financial fraud detection in cryptocurrency. I believe crypto is an emerging market with increasing fraud risks, making it a high impact area for applying ML and anomaly detection techniques.

Original Plan:

\- Handling Imbalanced Datasets from Open-sources (Elliptic Dataset, CipherTrace) – Since fraud cases are rare, techniques like SMOTE might be the way to go.  
\- Anomaly Detection Approaches:

* Autoencoders – For unsupervised anomaly detection and feature extraction.
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) – Since financial transactions naturally form networks, models like GCN or GAT could help detect suspicious connections.
* (Maybe both?)

Why This Project?

* I want to build an attractive portfolio in fraud detection and fintech as I’d love to contribute to fighting financial crime while also making a living in the field and I believe AML/CFT compliance and crypto fraud detection could benefit from AI-driven solutions.

My questions to you:

·       Any thoughts or suggestions on how to improve the approach?

·       Should I explore other ML models or techniques for fraud detection?

·       Any resources, datasets, or papers you'd recommend?

I'm still new to the DS world, so I’d appreciate any advice, feedback and critics.

1jhdo7j,"Management at my company claims to want coders / innovation, but rejects deliverables which aren't Excel","I work at a large financial firm. 
We have a ton of legacy Excel processes which require manual work, buggy add-ons or VBA code that takes several minutes to load. Spreadsheets that chug like hell to open or need to be operated with formula calculation off just to work in them.

Management will hype up ""innovation"" and will try to hire people with technical skills. They will send official communication talking about how the company is adopting AI and hyping up our internal chatbot (which is just some enterprise agreement with ChatGPT).

I've tried using python to automate some of our old processes. For example for adhoc deliverables, I'll use pandas and then style my work using great-tables, I'll plot stuff in plotly, etc.

I spend a lot of time styling my tables and plots to make them look professional. I use the company color scheme when creating them so that they look ""right"".

However, when I send stuff to my boss or his boss, they'll either complain that:

1) This doesn't look like the stuff that other people are doing

2) Will say ""I don't like the formatting"" but won't give specific examples on what to improve, won't provide examples of what constitutes good work

Independently of this, I recently spoke with a colleague who made attempts to move towards BI software such as Tableau for their processes. Even they have mentioned that the higher ups will ask for these types of solutions but ultimately prefer Excel's visuals for the deliverables.

I'm at a loss. I personally find Excel tables and graphs to be ugly, including the ones that my colleagues send. They look like something that a college student put together. If that's what the management wants, I'm inclined to stop complaining and just give it to them. But how would I actually do that in Python? 

In past jobs I've seen people do stuff like save ""Templates"" in Excel and have python spit the DF into the template. I've also heard there are packages that can create an excel file and then mark it up from within the code. At the end of the day this sounds like a recipe for me to create shitty code and unsustainable processes, which we already have plenty of. I want to be able to use a ""real"" plotting and table packages and perhaps just make something that is just good enough. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for me?

Edit: 

This post seems to have gained traction. I just wanted to clarify:
I think some people read this post as if my boss asked me to send an xlsx or csv file and I refused or am unwilling. That is not what happened. This is a post about visuals and formatting, i.e. sending emails or reports with inline tables and graphs/charts. If attaching an excel file with a raw DF were sufficient, obviously I would do that. 

Anyway I will look into using python/excel packages to mark up my stuff. Thanks",Fennecfox9,1742664359.0,266,70,0.97,text

1jgkdwa,Scheduling Optimization with Genetic Algorithms and CP,"Hi,

I have a problem for my thesis project, I will receive data soon and wanted to ask for opinions before i went into a rabbit hole. 

I have a metal sheet pressing scheduling problems with  

* n jobs for varying order sizes, orders can be split 
* m machines, 
* machines are identical in pressing times but their suitability for mold differs.
*  every job can be done with a list of suitable subset of molds that fit in certain molds 
* setup times are sequence dependant, there are differing setup times for changing molds, subset of molds, 
* changing of metal sheets, pressing each type of metal sheet differs so different processing times
*  there is only one of each mold certain machines can be used with certain molds 
* I need my model to run under 1 hour. the company that gave us this project could only achieve a feasible solution with cp within a couple hours.

My objectives are to decrease earliness, tardiness and setup times

I wanted to achieve this with a combination of Genetic Algorithms, some algorithm that can do local searches between iterations of genetic algorithms and constraint programming. My groupmate has suggested simulated anealing, hence the local search between ga iterations. 

My main concern is handling operational constraints in GA. I have a lot of constraints and i imagine most of the childs from the crossovers will be infeasible. This[ chromosome encoding ](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/218376)solves a lot of my problems but I still have to handle the fact that i can only use one mold at a time and the fact that this encoding does not consider idle times. We hope that constraint programming can add those idle times if we give the approximate machine, job allocations from the genetic algorithm. 

To handle idle times we also thought we could add 'dummy jobs' with no due dates, and no setup, only processing time so there wont be any earliness and tardiness cost. We could punish simultaneous usage of molds heavily in the fitness function. We hoped that optimally these dummy jobs could fit where we wanted there to be idle time, implicitly creating idle time. Is this a viable approach? How do people handle these kinds of stuff in genetic algorithms? Thank you for reading and giving your time.",NotMyRealName778,1742573165.0,9,11,0.91,text

Despite the fact in my 3 years of working i never really saw any point of going very deep into a single algorithm or method? Often not I found that breadth is better than depth especially when it’s our job to solve a problem as most of the heavy lifting is done.


Wouldn’t this mindset then really be toxic in workplaces but also be the reason why we have these unrealistic take-homes where a manager thinks a candidate should for example build a CNN model with 0 data on forensic bullet holes to automate forensic analytics.

Instead it’s better for the work geared more about actionability more than anything.

The issue is something that is probably well understood by everyone here. The data is horrific, the asks are unrealistic, and expectations are through the roof. 

The hard part is, when certain problems feel unsolvable given the setup (data quality, availability of historical data, etc), I often feel doubt that I am just not smart and not seeing some obvious solution. The leadership isn’t great from a technical side, so I don’t know how to grow. 

We had a model that we worked on for ages on a difficult problem that we got down to ~6% RMSE, and the client told us that much error is basically useless. I was so proud of it! It was months of work of gathering sources and optimizing.

At the same time, I don’t want to say ‘this is the best you will get’, because the work has already been sold. It feels like I have to be a snake oil salesmen to succeed, which I am good at but feels wrong. Plus, maybe I’m just missing something obvious that could solve these things…

1javfus,Do you deal with unrealistic expectations from non-technical people frequently?,"I've been working at my job for a year and in data itself for several years. I'm willing to admit my shortcomings, willing to admit mistakes and learn.

However, there are several times where I feel like I've been in situations where there is 'no-winning'. Recently, I've inherited a task from a colleague who has left. There is no documentation. My only way of understanding this task is through the colleague who assigned it to me, who is not really a technical person. I've inherited code which is repetitive/redundant, difficult to follow and understand. What I REALLY want to do is spend time cleaning up this code so that debugging is easier and this code can run better but I'm not given a chance to do this b/c everytime I get a request related to this project, I'm asked to churn something out in less than a day. This feels unrealistic b/c I don't even have time to understand the outcome and whenever I do exactly as my collague asks, it has times broken something downstream, forcing me to undo this as soon as possible. This has put a strain on other tasks and so when I put this task to the side to do other tasks, there's been frustration expressed on me for not doing this task sooner.

The same colleague who assigned me this task initially told me that if I need help in understanding the requirements, he can help with that. When I've gone to him to ask questions or send updates, he himself looks like he doesn't have time to answer my questions because of back to back meetings. When he doesn't respond, then he expresses frustration to my boss and other senior colleagues when I haven't done something b/c I'm still waiting for a response b/c 'it's taking too long'. My boss has expressed to me he feels I don't ask enough questions that could be 'holding up the process'. So I have tried to ask more questions, but when colleagues can't get back to me on time, I'm told I'm not asking the right people or if I ask a question, I'm told I'm not 'asking the right question'. For example, this same colleague wanted me to fix a bug and wrote that this bug is causing ""unexpected results"". A senior colleague asked me if the requirements to fix this bug are clear to me and I thought to just clarify with the colleague who put in the bug fix request ""do you want me to remove these records or figure out how to best include them in the end result"". My boss saw my response and said ""you're not asking the right question! you're not supposed to ask people to do YOUR work for you"". From my point of view, I wasn't asking anybody to do my work b/c I'm the one ultimately who will dive into the code to fix things.

I'm at a loss tbh....I'm trying to do all the right things, trying to also improve my 'people skills' and understand what people want and how to streamline things. I know there's more room for improvement for me, but I am struggling with conflicting advice and lack of direction.

1j87x92,How do you deal with coworkers that are adamant about their ways despite it blowing up in the past.,"Was discussing with a peer and they are very adamant of using randomized splits as its easy despite the fact that I proved that data sampling is problematic for replication as the data will never be the same even with random_seed set up. Factors like environment and hardware play a role.

I been pushing for model replication is a bare minimum standard as if someone else cant replicate the results then how can they validate it? We work in a heavily regulated field and I had to save a project from my predecessor where the entire thing was on the verge of being pulled out because none of the results could be replicated by a third party.

My coworker says that the standard shouldn’t be set up but i personally believe that replication is a bare minimum regardless as models isnt just fitting and predicting with 0 validation. If anything we need to ensure that our model is stable. 

The person constantly challenges everything I say and refuses to acknowledge the merit of methodology.  I dont mind people challenging but constantly saying I dont see the point or it doesn’t matter when it does infact matter by 3rd party validators. 

This person when working with them I had to constantly slow them down and stop them from rushing Through the work as it literally contains tons of mistakes. This is like a common occurrence. 


Edit: i see a few comments in, My manager was in the discussion as my coworker brought it up in our stand up and i had to defend my position in-front of my bosses (director and above). Basically what they said is “apparently we have to do this because I say this is what should be done now given the need to replicate”.

1j5t5gp,Agent flow vs. data science,"I just wrapped up an experiment exploring how the number of agents (or steps) in an AI pipeline affects classification accuracy. Specifically, I tested four different setups on a movie review classification task. My initial hypothesis going into this was essentially, ""*More agents might mean a more thorough analysis, and therefore higher accuracy.""* But, as you'll see, it's not quite that straightforward.

# Results Summary

I have used the first 1000 reviews from IMDB  dataset to classify reviews into positive or negative. I used gpt-4o-mini as a model.

Here are the final results from the experiment:

|Pipeline Approach|Accuracy|
|:-|:-|
|Classification Only|0.95|
|Summary → Classification|0.94|
|Summary → Statements → Classification|0.93|
|Summary → Statements → Explanation → Classification|0.94|

Let's break down each step and try to see what's happening here.

# Step 1: Classification Only

*(Accuracy: 0.95)*

This simplest approach—simply reading a review and classifying it as positive or negative—provided the highest accuracy of all four pipelines. The model was straightforward and did its single task exceptionally well without added complexity.

# Step 2: Summary → Classification

*(Accuracy: 0.94)*

Next, I introduced an extra agent that produced an emotional summary of the reviews before the classifier made its decision. Surprisingly, accuracy slightly dropped to 0.94. It looks like the summarization step possibly introduced abstraction or subtle noise into the input, leading to slightly lower overall performance.

# Step 3: Summary → Statements → Classification

*(Accuracy: 0.93)*

Adding yet another step, this pipeline included an agent designed to extract key emotional statements from the review. My assumption was that added clarity or detail at this stage might improve performance. Instead, overall accuracy dropped a bit further to 0.93. While the statements created by this agent might offer richer insights on emotion, they clearly introduced complexity or noise the classifier couldn't optimally handle.

# Step 4: Summary → Statements → Explanation → Classification

*(Accuracy: 0.94)*

Finally, another agent was introduced that provided human readable explanations alongside the material generated in prior steps. This boosted accuracy slightly back up to 0.94, but didn't quite match the original simple classifier's performance. The major benefit here was increased interpretability rather than improved classification accuracy.

# Analysis and Takeaways

Here are some key points we can draw from these results:

# More Agents Doesn't Automatically Mean Higher Accuracy.

Adding layers and agents can significantly aid in interpretability and extracting structured, valuable data—like emotional summaries or detailed explanations—but each step also comes with risks. Each guy in the pipeline can introduce new errors or noise into the information it's passing forward.

# Complexity Versus Simplicity

The simplest classifier, with a single job to do (direct classification), actually ended up delivering the top accuracy. Although multi-agent pipelines offer useful modularity and can provide great insights, they're not necessarily the best option if raw accuracy is your number one priority.

# Always Double Check Your Metrics.

Different datasets, tasks, or model architectures could yield different results. Make sure you are consistently evaluating tradeoffs—interpretability, extra insights, and user experience vs. accuracy.

In the end, ironically, the simplest methodology—just directly classifying the review—gave me the highest accuracy. For situations where richer insights or interpretability matter, multiple-agent pipelines can still be extremely valuable even if they don't necessarily outperform simpler strategies on accuracy alone.

I'd love to get thoughts from everyone else who has experimented with these multi-agent setups. Did you notice a similar pattern (the simpler approach being as good or slightly better), or did you manage to achieve higher accuracy with multiple agents?

Full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Pravko-Solutions/FlashLearn/tree/main/examples/agent_patterns)

# TL;DR

Adding multiple steps or agents can bring deeper insight and structure to your AI pipelines, but it won't always give you higher accuracy. Sometimes, keeping it simple is actually the best choice.",No_Information6299,1741366018.0,21,10,0.8,text

I’m a 3rd year CS undergrad and currently have a MacBook M2 Air with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. I bought it in 2022 for about $2000 CAD, but I’ve been running into issues. When I open multiple apps like Docker, Ollama, PyCharm, and run training models, the laptop quickly runs out of RAM and gets heat up and starts swapping, which isn’t great for the SSD.

I’m leaning towards selling it to upgrade to an M4 Pro, especially for machine learning and data science tasks. However, Apple’s trade-in value is only around $585 CAD, and I just recently had the motherboard, chassis, and display replaced (everything except the battery), so my laptop is basically new in most parts. I was planning to sell it on Facebook Marketplace, but I’m not sure what price I should target now that the M4 has been released.

On the flip side, I’ve also considered keeping the laptop and using a Google Colab subscription for ML work. But running many applications still leads to heavy swap usage, which could harm the SSD in the long run. Given that I just renewed some parts, it might be the best time to sell for a higher resale value.

If I decide to upgrade to the M4, I’m thinking of getting a model with at least 24GB RAM and a 10-core CPU and GPU combination. Do you guys think that would be enough to future-proof it?

1j2fd49,Soft skills: How do you make the rest of the organization contribute to data quality?,"I've been in six different data teams in my career, two of them as an employee and four as a consultant. Often we run into a wall when it comes to data quality where the quality will not improve unless the rest of the organization works to better it.

For example, if the dev team doesn't test the event measuring and deploy a new version, you don't get any data until you figure out what the problem is, ask them to fix it, and they deploy the fix. They say that they will test it next time, but it doesn't become a priority and happens a few months later again.

Or when a team is supposed to reach a certain KPI they will cut corners and do a weird process to reach it, making the measurement useless. For example, when employees on the ground are rewarded for the ""order to deliver"" time, they might check something as delivered once it's completed but not actually delivered, because they don't get rewarded for completing the task quickly only delivering it.

How do you engage with the rest organization to make them care about the data quality and meet you half way?

One thing I've kept doing at new organizations is trying to build an internal data product for the data producing teams, so that they can become a stakeholder in the data quality. If they don't get their processes in order, their data product stops working. This has had mixed results, form completely transformning the company to not having any impact at all. I've also tried holding workshops, and they seem to work for a while, but as people change departments and other stuff happens, this knowledge gets lost or deprioritized again.

At the moment I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for textbooks or other documents detailing domain adaptation in the context of synthetic to real data for when the sets are not aligned

So I'm forecasting some sales data.  Mainly units sold.  They want a daily forecast (I tried to push them towards weekly but here we are).

I have a decades worth of data, I need to model out the effects of lockdowns obviously as well as like a bazillion campaigns they run throughout the year.

I've done some feature engineering and I've tried running it through multiple regression but that doesn't seem to work there are just so many parameters.  I computed a PCA on the input sales data and I'm feeding the lagged scores into the model which helps to reduce the number of features.

I am currently trying Gaussian Process Regression, the results are not generalizing well at all.  Definitely getting overfitting.  It gives 90% R2 and incredibly low rmse on training data, then garbage on validation.  The actual predictions do not track the real data as well at all.  Honestly was getting better just reconstruction from the previous day's PCA.  Considering doing some cross validation and hyper parameter tuning, any general advice on how to proceed?  I'm basically just throwing models at the wall to see what sticks would appreciate any advice.

So I'm hoping someone here could point me in the direction to start learning more.

So some background.  In my job I help monitor the moving and processing of various files as they move between vendors/systems.

So for example we may a file that is generated daily named customerDataMMDDYY.rpt  where MMDDYY is the month day year.  Yet another file might have a naming convention like genericReport394MMDDYY492.csv

So what I would like to is to try and build a learning system that monitors the master data stream of file transfers that does two things

1) automatically detects naming conventions  
2) for each naming convention/pattern found in step 1, detect the ""normal"" cadence of the file movement.  For example is it 7 days a week, just week days, once a month?  
3) once 1,2 are set up, then alert if a file misses it's cadence.

Now I know how to get 2 and 3 set up.  However I'm having a hard time building a system to detect the naming conventions.  I have some ideas on how to get it done but hitting dead ends so hoping someone here might be able to offer some help.

1iygj98,Is there a large pool of incompetent data scientists out there?,"Having moved from academia to data science in industry, I've had a strange series of interactions with other data scientists that has left me very confused about the state of the field, and I am wondering if it's just by chance or if this is a common experience? Here are a couple of examples:

I was hired to lead a small team doing data science in a large utilities company. Most senior person under me, who was referred to as the senior data scientists had no clue about anything and was actively running the team into the dust. Could barely write a for loop, couldn't use git. Took two years to get other parts of business to start trusting us. Had to push to get the individual made redundant because they were a serious liability. It was so problematic working with them I felt like they were a plant from a competitor trying to sabotage us.

Start hiring a new data scientist very recently. Lots of applicants, some with very impressive CVs, phds, experience etc. I gave a handful of them a very basic take home assessment, and the work I got back was mind boggling. The majority had no idea what they were doing, couldn't merge two data frames properly, didn't even look at the data at all by eye just printed summary stats. I was and still am flabbergasted they have high paying jobs in other places.  They would need major coaching to do basic things in my team. 

So my question is: is there a pool of ""fake"" data scientists out there muddying the job market and ruining our collective reputation, or have I just been really unlucky?",AnUncookedCabbage,1740548664.0,840,402,0.94,text

1iy6v4d,I get the impression that traditional statistical models are out-of-place with Big Data. What's the modern view on this?,"I'm a Data Scientist, but not good enough at Stats to feel confident making a statement like this one. But it seems to me that:

* Traditional statistical tests were built with the expectation that sample sizes would generally be around 20 - 30 people
* Applying them to Big Data situations where our groups consist of millions of people and reflect nearly 100% of the population is problematic

Specifically, I'm currently working on a A/B Testing project for websites, where people get different variations of a website and we measure the impact on conversion rates. Stakeholders have complained that it's very hard to reach statistical significance using the popular A/B Testing tools, like Optimizely and have tasked me with building a A/B Testing tool from scratch.

To start with the most basic possible approach, I started by running a z-test to compare the conversion rates of the variations and found that, using that approach, you can reach a statistically significant p-value with about 100 visitors. Results are about the same with chi-squared and t-tests, and you can usually get a pretty great effect size, too.

Cool -- but all of these data points are absolutely wrong. If you wait and collect weeks of data anyway, you can see that these effect sizes that were classified as statistically significant are completely incorrect.

It seems obvious to me that the fact that popular A/B Testing tools take a long time to reach statistical significance is a feature, not a flaw.

But there's a lot I don't understand here:

* What's the theory behind adjusting approaches to statistical testing when using Big Data? How are modern statisticians ensuring that these tests are more rigorous?
* What does this mean about traditional statistical approaches? If I can see, using Big Data, that my z-tests and chi-squared tests are calling inaccurate results significant when they're given small sample sizes, does this mean there are issues with these approaches in all cases?

The fact that so many modern programs are already much more rigorous than simple tests suggests that these are questions people have already identified and solved. Can anyone direct me to things I can read to better understand the issue?",takenorinvalid,1740520105.0,96,66,0.8,text

This was the main reason the company hired us, trying to in-house the project for cheaper than what they were charging.

Basically just an ensemble method. But what does “distilled” mean, they imported the models ie pytorch? Or they cloned the repo in full? And put data thru all models in a pipeline?

I’m also a bit unclear on the whole concept of synthetic data. To me this seems like a HUGE no no, but according to my chat with DeepSeek, they did use synthetic data.

I’d like to start analyzing 10+ years once I am confident I can capture the pdf data without manual intervention. I’d like to automate this process.

First off let me say I used to agree when I was a junior. But now that I have 10 yoe I have the opposite opinion. I've seen so many boondoggles promise massive long-term ROI and a bunch of phds and other ds folks being paid 200k+/year would take years to develop a model that barely improved the bottom line, whereas a lookup table could get 90% of the way there and have practically no costs.


The other analogy I use is pretend you're the customer. The plumbing in your house broke and your toilets don't work. One plumber comes in and says they can fix it in a day for $200. Another comes and says they and their team needs 3 months to do a full scientific study of the toilet and your house and maximize ROI for you, because just fixing it might not be the best long-term ROI. And you need to pay them an even higher hourly than the first plumber for months of work, since they have specialized scientific skills the first plumber doesn't have. Then when you go with the first one the second one complains that you're so shortsighted and don't see the value of science and are just short-term greedy. And you're like dude I just don't want to have to piss and shit in my yard for 3 months and I don't want to pay you tens of thousands of dollars when this other guy can fix it for $200.",None,1739845645.0,205,53,0.94,text

The goal is to make robust apps that work well with multiple concurrent users. Should support asynchronous operations for long running calculations.

Edit:
It seems that for simple to intermediate level complex apps, Shiny for R/Python or FastHTML are great options. The main advantage is that you can write all frontend and backend code in a single language. FastAPI authors developed FastHTML and they say it can replace FastAPI + JS frontend.

1iolgcd,Is Managing Unstructured Data a Pain Point for the AI/RAG Ecosystem? Can It Be Solved by Well-Designed Software?,"Hey Redditors,

I've been brainstorming about a software solution that could potentially address a significant gap in the AI-enhanced information retrieval systems, particularly in the realm of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While these systems have advanced considerably, there's still a major production challenge: managing the real-time validity, updates, and deletion of documents forming the knowledge base.

Currently, teams need to appoint managers to oversee the governance of these unstructured data, similar to how structured databases like SQL are managed. This is a complex task that requires dedicated jobs and suitable tools.

Here's my idea: develop a unified user interface (UI) specifically for document ingestion, advanced data management, and transformation into synchronized vector databases. The final product would serve as a single access point per document base, allowing clients to perform semantic searches using their AI agents. The UI would encourage data managers to keep their information up-to-date through features like notifications, email alerts, and document expiration dates.

The project could start as open-source, with a potential revenue model involving a paid service to deploy AI agents connected to the document base.

Some technical challenges include ensuring the accuracy of embeddings and dealing with chunking strategies for document processing. As technology advances, these hurdles might lessen, shifting the focus to the quality and relevance of the source document base.

1iibksg,How do you all quantify the revenue impact of your work product?,"I'm (mostly) an academic so pardon my cluelessness.

A lot of the advice given on here as to how to write an effective resume for industry roles revolves around quantifying the revenue impact of the projects you and your team undertook in your current role. In that, it is not enough to simply discuss technical impact (increased accuracy of predictions, improved quality of data etc) but the impact a project had on a firm's bottom line.

But it seems to me that quantifying the \*causal\* impact of an ML system, or some other standard data science project, is itself a data science project. In fact, one could hire a data scientist (or economist) whose sole job is to audit the effectiveness of data science projects in a firm.  I bet you aren't running diff-in-diffs or estimating production functions, to actually ascertain revenue impact. So how are you guys figuring it out?",Ok_Composer_1761,1738766793.0,73,64,0.96,text
1iicldl,"Advice on Building Live Odds Model (ETL Pipeline, Database, Predictive Modeling, API)","I'm working on a side project right now that is designed to be a plugin for a Rocket League mod called BakkesMod that will calculate and display live odds win odds for each team to the player. These will be calculated by taking live player/team stats obtained through the BakkesMod API, sending them to a custom API that accepts the inputs, runs them as variables through predictive models, and returns the odds to the frontend. I have some questions about the architecture/infrastructure that would best be suited. Keep in mind that this is a personal side project so the scale is not massive, but I'd still like it to be fairly thorough and robust.

# Data Pipeline:

My idea is to obtain json data from [Ballchasing.com](http://ballchasing.com/) through their API from the last thirty days to produce relevant models (I don't want data from 2021 to have weight in predicting gameplay in 2025). My ETL pipeline doesn't need to be immediately up-to-date, so I figured I'd automate it to run weekly.

From here, I'd store this data in both AWS S3 and a PostgreSQL database. The S3 bucket will house parquet files assembled from the flattened json data that is received straight from Ballchasing to be used for longer term data analysis and comparison. Storing in S3 Infrequent Access (IA) would be $0.0125/GB and converting it to the Glacier Flexible Retrieval type in S3 after a certain amount of time with a lifecycle rule would be $0.0036/GB. I estimate that a single day's worth of Parquet files would be maybe 20MB, so if I wanted to keep, let's say 90 days worth of data in IA and the rest in Glacier Flexible, that would only be $0.0225 for IA (1.8GB) and I wouldn't reach $0.10/mo in Glacier Flexible costs until 3.8 years worth of data past 90 days old (~27.78GB). Obviously there are costs associated with data requests, but with the small amount of requests I'll be triggering, it's effectively negligible.

As for the Postgres DB, I plan on hosting it on AWS RDS. I will only ever retain the last thirty days worth of data. This means that every weekly run would remove the oldest seven days of data and populate with the newest seven days of data. Overall, I estimate a single day's worth of SQL data being about 25-30 MB, making my total maybe around 750-900 MB. Either way, it's safe to say I'm not looking to store a monumental amount of data.

During data extraction, each group of data entries for a specific day will be transformed to prepare it for loading into the Postgres DB (30 day retention) and writing to parquet files to be stored in S3 (IA -> Glacier Flexible). Afterwards, I'll perform EDA on the cleaned data with Polars to determine things like weights of different stats related to winning matches and what type of modeling library I should use (scikit-learn, PyTorch, XGBoost).

# API:

After developing models for different ranks and game modes, I'd serve them through a gRPC API written in Go. The goal is to be able to just send relevant stats to the API, insert them as variables in the models, and return odds back to the frontend. I have not decided where to store these models yet (S3?).

I doubt it would be necessary, but I did think about using Kafka to stream these results because that's a technology I haven't gotten to really use that interests me, and I feel it may be applicable here (albeit probably not necessary).

# Automation:

As I said earlier, I plan on this pipeline being run weekly. Whether that includes EDA and iterative updates to the models is something I will encounter in the future, but for now, I'd be fine with those steps being manual. I don't foresee my data pipeline being too overwhelming for AWS Lambda, so I think I'll go with that. If it ends up taking too long to run there, I could just run it on an EC2 instance that is turned on/off before/after the pipeline is scheduled to run. I've never used CloudWatch, but I'm of the assumption that I can use that to automate these runs on Lambda. I can conduct basic CI/CD through GitHub actions.

# Frontend

The frontend will not have to be hosted anywhere because it's facilitated through Rocket League as a plugin. It's a simple text display and the in-game live stats will be gathered using BakkesMod's API.

# Questions:

* Does anything seem ridiculous, overkill, or not enough for my purposes? Have I made any mistakes in my choices of technologies and tools?
* What recommendations would you give me for this architecture/infrastructure
* What should I use to transform and prep the data for load into S3/Postgres
* What would be the best service to store my predictive models?
* Is it reasonable to include Kafka in this project to get experience with it even though it's probably not necessary?

Thanks for any help!

I've finished and I spent way more than 2 hours on this, as I feel like in this job market, I shouldn't take the risk of turning in a sloppier take home task. I've looked around and seen that others who were given 2 hour take homes also spent way more time on their tasks as well. It just feels like common sense to use all the time I was actually given, especially since other candidates are going to do so as well, but I'm worried that a hiring manager and recruiter might look at this and think ""They obviously spent more than 2 hours"".

It is a pretrained transformer which outperforms existing SOTA for small tabular data. You can read it in 🔗 [**Nature**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6).

Some key highlights:

* It outperforms an ensemble of strong baselines tuned for 4 hours in 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression tasks, for datasets up to 10,000 samples and 500 features
* It is robust to uninformative features and can natively handle numerical and categorical features as well as missing values.
* Pretrained on 130 million synthetically generated datasets, it is a generative transformer model which allows for fine-tuning, data generation and density estimation.
* TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.
* TabPFN v2 can be used for forecasting by featurizing the timestamps. It ranks #1 on the popular time-series GIFT-Eval [benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval) and outperforms Chronos.

1igpsrg,"About data processing, data science, tiger style and assertions","I recently came across a video in youtube mentioning this [tiger coding style](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md) and the assertions part is quite interesting.

> Assertions detect programmer errors. Unlike operating errors, which are expected and which must be handled, assertion failures are unexpected. The only correct way to handle corrupt code is to crash. Assertions downgrade catastrophic correctness bugs into liveness bugs. Assertions are a force multiplier for discovering bugs by fuzzing.

This style only reinforces that the practice that I already used to is relevant in other fields and I try to use that as much as I can BUT it seems to be only plausible to use for metadata and function parameters, and not the actual data we work with. I say that because if the dataset is large enough, then any assertion would take a lot of time and slow the actual program execution.

**Should I do a lot of assertions that reduce performance or should I ignore the need for error detection and not use any assertions during data processing?**
