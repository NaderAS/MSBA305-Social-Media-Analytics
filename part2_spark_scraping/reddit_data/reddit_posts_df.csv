10,1k1vo23,Advice before getting data engineer fellowship position,"Hey everybody,

I need some advice. I have an MsC in Data Science and have really struggled to find jobs. I got an average paying, “data science adjacent but not data science enough” quantitative analyst job in a bank. In fact , I feel like I get dumber every day I’m there and I’m miserable. None of the skills or achievements there are noteworthy : no model building, no big analyses, no data engineering or Gen ai work, just model validation work (helping other people fix their modeling solutions).

Long story short, I’m interviewing for a fellowship position to be a data engineer in a nonprofit. It lasts for one year and exposes me to many clients that I will aid. At most I can extend the fellowship for one additional year. It sounds exciting. It pays 10K less, but it’s a step in the right direction. It gets me closer to what I actually studied.

The reason I write this post is because I want to know if it will negatively impact my resume or future chances. If I take this job, my resume will look like this : data analyst job (3 years) with a bit of sql and excel, two data science internships (one 3 months and one 8 months) at the university, quantitative analyst (6months), data engineer fellowship (1 year). Will this make companies look at me like a problem and not give me a chance to even interview? Thanks in advance, everybody.

14,1k0zcye,Data Engineer trying to understand data science to provide better support.,"I work as a data engineer who mainly builds & maintains data warehouses but now I’m starting to get projects assigned to me asking me to build custom data pipelines for various data science projects and I’m assuming deployment of Data Science/ML models to production. 

Since my background is data engineering, how can I learn data science in a structured bottom up manner so that I can best understand what exactly the data scientists want? 

This may sound like overkill to some but so far the data scientist I’m working with is trying to build a data science model that requires enriched historical data for the training of the data science model. Ok no problem so far. 

However, they then want to run the data science model on the data as it’s collected (before enrichment) but the problem is this data science model is trained on enriched historical data that wont have the exact same schema as the data that’s being collected real time?

What’s even more confusing is some data scientists have said this is ok and some said it isn’t.

I don’t know which person is right. So, I’d rather learn at least the basics, preferably through some good books & projects so that I can understand when the data scientists are asking for something unreasonable.

I need to be able to easily speak the language of data scientists so I can provide better support and let them know when there’s an issue with the data that may effect their data science model in unexpected ways. ",khaili109,1744848145.0,59,31,0.91

18,1k0vdku,Quick question regarding nested resampling and model selection workflow,"Just wanted some feedback regarding my model selection approach.

The premise:  
Need to train dev a model and I will need to perform nested resmapling to prevent against spatial and temporal leakage.  
Outer samples will handle spatial leakage.  
Inner samples will handle temporal leakage.  
I will also be tuning a model.

Via the diagram below, my model tuning and selection will be as follows:  
\-Make inital 70/30 data budget  
\-Perfrom some number of spatial resamples (4 shown here)  
\-For each spatial resample (1-4), I will make N (4 shown) spatial splits  
\-For each inner time sample i will train and test N (4 shown) models and mark their perfromance  
\-For each outer samples' inner samples - one winner model will be selected based on some criteria  
\--e.g Model A out performs all models trained innner samples 1-4 for outer sample #1  
\----Outer/spatial #1 -- winner model A  
\----Outer/spatial #2 -- winner model D  
\----Outer/spatial #3 -- winner model C  
\----Outer/spatial #4 -- winner model A  
\-I take each winner from the previous step and train them on their entire train sets and validate on their test sets  
\--e.g train model A on outer #1 train and test on outer #1 test  
\----- train model D on outer #2 train and test on outer #2 test  
\----- and so on  
\-From this step the model the perfroms the best is then selected from these 4 and then trained on the entire inital 70% train and evalauated on the inital 30% holdout.

Should I change my method up at all?  
I was thinking that I might be adding bias in to the second modeling step (training the winning models on the outer/spatial samples) because there could be differences in the spatial samples themselves.   
Potentially some really bad data ends up exclusively in the test set for one of the outer folds and by default make one of the models not be selected that otherwise might have.

27,1jxl18x,Ace The Interview - SQL Intuitively and Exhaustively Explained,"SQL is easy to learn and hard to master. Realistically, the difficulty of the questions you get will largely be dictated by the job role you're trying to fill.

From it's highest level, SQL is a ""declarative language"", meaning it doesn't define a set of operations, but rather a desired end result. This can make SQL incredibly expressive, but also a bit counterintuitive, especially if you aren't fully aware of it's declarative nature.

SQL expressions are passed through an SQL engine, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. Thes engines parse out your SQL expressions, optimize them, and turn them into an actual list of steps to get the data you want. While not as often discussed, for beginners I recommend SQLite. It's easy to set up in virtually any environment, and allows you to get rocking with SQL quickly. If you're working in big data, I recommend also brushing up on something like PostgreSQL, but the differences are not so bad once you have a solid SQL understanding.

In being a high level declaration, SQL’s grammatical structure is, fittingly, fairly high level. It’s kind of a weird, super rigid version of English. SQL queries are largely made up of:

* **Keywords:** special words in SQL that tell an engine what to do. Some common ones, which we’ll discuss, are `SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY` . They can be lowercase or uppercase, but usually they’re written in uppercase.
* **Identifiers:** Identifiers are the names of database objects like tables, columns, etc.
* **Literals:** numbers, text, and other hardcoded values
* **Operators:** Special characters or keywords used in comparison and arithmetic operations. For example `!=`, `<` ,`OR`, `NOT` , `*`, `/`, `%` , `IN`, `LIKE` . We’ll cover these later.
* **Clauses:** These are the major building block of SQL, and can be stitched together to combine a queries general behavior. They usually start with a keyword, like 
   * `SELECT` – defines which columns to return 
   * `FROM` – defines the source table 
   * `WHERE` – filters rows 
   * `GROUP BY` – groups rows etc.  

By combining these clauses, you create an SQL query

There are a ton of things you can do in SQL, like create tables:

    CREATE TABLE People(first_name, last_name, age, favorite_color)

Insert data into tables:

    INSERT INTO People
    VALUES
        ('Tom', 'Sawyer', 19, 'White'),
        ('Mel', 'Gibson', 69, 'Green'),
        ('Daniel', 'Warfiled', 27, 'Yellow')

Select certain data from tables:

    SELECT first_name, favorite_color FROM People

Search based on some filter

    SELECT * FROM People WHERE id = 3

And Delete Data

    DELETE FROM People WHERE age < 30 

What was previously mentioned makes up the cornerstone of pretty much all of SQL. Everything else builds on it, and there is a lot.

**Primary and Foreign Keys**  
A *primary key* is a unique identifier for each record in a table. A *foreign key* references a primary key in another table, allowing you to relate data across tables. This is the backbone of relational database design.

**Super Keys and Composite Keys**  
A *super key* is any combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row. When a unique combination requires multiple columns, it’s often called a *composite key* — useful in complex schemas like logs or transactions.

**Normalization and Database Design**  
Normalization is the process of splitting data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy. First Normal Form (1NF) ensures atomic rows, Second Normal Form (2NF) separates logically distinct data, and Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates derived data stored in the same table.

**Creating Relational Schemas in SQLite**  
You can explicitly define tables with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints using `CREATE TABLE`. These relationships enforce referential integrity and enable behaviors like cascading deletes. SQLite enforces `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints strictly, making your schema more robust.

**Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**  
ERDs visually represent tables and their relationships. Dotted lines and cardinality markers like `{0,1}` or `0..N` indicate how many records in one table relate to another, which helps document and debug schema logic.

**JOINs**  
JOIN operations combine rows from multiple tables using foreign keys. `INNER JOIN` includes only matched rows, `LEFT JOIN` includes all from the left table, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (emulated in SQLite) combines both. Proper JOINs are critical for data integration.

**Filtering and LEFT/RIGHT JOIN Differences**  
JOIN order affects which rows are preserved when there’s no match. For example, using `LEFT JOIN` ensures all left-hand rows are kept — useful for identifying unmatched data. SQLite lacks `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can simulate it by flipping the table order in a `LEFT JOIN`.

**Simulating FULL OUTER JOINs**  
SQLite doesn’t support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but you can emulate it with a `UNION` of two `LEFT JOIN` queries and a `WHERE` clause to catch nulls from both sides. This approach ensures no records are lost in either table.

**The WHERE Clause and Filtration**  
`WHERE` filters records based on conditions, supporting logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), numeric comparisons, and string operations like `LIKE`, `IN`, and `REGEXP`. It's one of the most frequently used clauses in SQL.

**DISTINCT Selections**  
Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique values from a column. You can also select distinct combinations of columns (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT name, grade`) to avoid duplicate rows in the result.

**Grouping and Aggregation Functions**  
With `GROUP BY`, you can compute metrics like `AVG`, `SUM`, or `COUNT` for each group. `HAVING` lets you filter grouped results, like showing only departments with an average salary above a threshold.

**Ordering and Limiting Results**  
`ORDER BY` sorts results by one or more columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, and `OFFSET` lets you skip rows — useful for pagination or ranked listings.

**Updating and Deleting Data**  
`UPDATE` modifies existing rows using `SET`, while `DELETE` removes rows based on `WHERE` filters. These operations can be combined with other clauses to selectively change or clean up data.

**Handling NULLs**  
`NULL` represents missing or undefined values. You can detect them using `IS NULL` or replace them with defaults using `COALESCE`. Aggregates like `AVG(column)` ignore NULLs by default, while `COUNT(*)` includes all rows.

**Subqueries**  
Subqueries are nested `SELECT` statements used inside `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT`. They’re useful for filtering by aggregates, comparisons, or generating intermediate results for more complex logic.

**Correlated Subqueries**  
These are subqueries that reference columns from the outer query. Each row in the outer query is matched against a custom condition in the subquery — powerful but often inefficient unless optimized.

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
CTEs let you define temporary named result sets with `WITH`. They make complex queries readable by breaking them into logical steps and can be used multiple times within the same query.

**Recursive CTEs**  
Recursive CTEs solve hierarchical problems like org charts or category trees. A base case defines the start, and a recursive step extends the output until no new rows are added. Useful for generating sequences or computing reporting chains.

**Window Functions**  
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Examples include `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER ()`, and moving averages with sliding windows.

These all can be combined together to do a lot of different stuff.

In my opinion, this is too much to learn efficiently learn outright. It requires practice and the slow aggregation of concepts over many projects. If you're new to SQL, I recommend studying the basics and learning through doing. However, if you're on the job hunt and you need to cram, you might find this breakdown useful: [https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively](https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively)",Daniel-Warfield,1744474855.0,220,14,0.88

A prior company got sold a Return on Marketing Invest project by one of the big 4 consultancies.  The basis of it was build a bunch of MMMs, pump the budget in, and it automatically tells what you where to spend the budget to get the most bang for you buck.  Sounds wonderful.

I was the DS shadowing the consultancy to learn the models, so we could do a refresh.  The company had an annual marketing budget of 250m€ and its revenue was between 1.5 and 2bn €.

Once I got into doing the refresh, I really felt the process was never going to succeed.  Marketing thought ""there's 3 years of data, we must have a good model"", but in reality 3\*52 weeks is a tiny amount of data, when you try to fit in TV, Radio, Press, OOH, Whitemail, Email, Search, Social, and then include prices from you and comp, and seasonal variables.

You need to adstock each media to take affect for lags - and finding the level of adstock requires experimentation. The 156 weeks need to have a test and possibly a validation set given the experiments.

The business is then interested in things like what happens when we do TV and OOH together, which means creating combined variables.  More variables on very little data.

I am a practical Data Scientist.  I don't get hung up on the technical details and am focused on generating value, but this whole process seemed a crazy and expensive waste of time.  

The positive that came out of it was that we started doing AB testing in certain areas where the initial models suggested there was very low return, and those areas had previously been very resistant to any kind of testing.  

This feels a bit like a rant, but I'm genuinely interested if people think it can work.  It feels like its a over promising in the worst way.",SonicBoom_81,1744450729.0,112,49,0.94

32,1jxe7rg,[Help] Modeling Tariff Impacts on Trade Flow,"
I'm working on a trade flow forecasting system that uses the RAS algorithm to disaggregate high-level forecasts to detailed commodity classifications. The system works well with historical data, but now I need to incorporate the impact of new tariffs without having historical tariff data to work with.

Current approach:
- Use historical trade patterns as a base matrix
- Apply RAS to distribute aggregate forecasts while preserving patterns

Need help with:
- Methods to estimate tariff impacts on trade volumes by commodity
- Incorporating price elasticity of demand
- Modeling substitution effects (trade diversion)
- Integrating these elements with our RAS framework

Any suggestions for modeling approaches that could work with limited historical tariff data? Particularly interested in econometric methods or data science techniques that maintain consistency across aggregation levels.

33,1jwbevk,What technical skills should young data scientists be learning?,"Data science is obviously a broad and ill-defined term, but most DS jobs today fall into one of the following flavors:

- Data analysis (a/b testing, causal inference, experimental design)

- Traditional ML (supervised learning, forecasting, clustering) 

- Data engineering (ETL, cloud development, model monitoring, data modeling)

- Applied Science (Deep learning, optimization, Bayesian methods, recommender systems, typically more advanced and niche, requiring doctoral education)

The notion of a “full stack” data scientist has declined in popularity, and it seems that many entrants into the field need to decide one of the aforementioned areas to specialize in to build a career. 

For instance, a seasoned product DS will be the best candidate for senior product DS roles, but not so much for senior data engineering roles, and vice versa. 

Since I find learning and specializing in everything to be infeasible, I am interested in figuring out which of these “paths” will equip one with the most employable skillset, especially given how fast “AI” is changing the landscape. 

For instance, when I talk to my product DS friends, they advise to learn how to develop software and use cloud platforms since it is essential in the age of big data, even though they rarely do this on the job themselves. 

My data engineer friends on the other hand say that data engineering tools are easy to learn, change too often, and are becoming increasingly abstracted, making developing a strong product/business sense a wiser choice. 

Is either group right? 

Am I overthinking and would be better off just following whichever path interests me most? 

EDIT: I think the essence of my question was to assume that candidates have solid business knowledge. Given this, which skillset is more likely to survive in today and tomorrow’s job market given AI advancements and market conditions. Saying all or multiple pathways will remain important is also an acceptable answer. ",etherealcabbage72,1744326138.0,387,73,0.97

# The position bias in LLMs is the root cause of the problem

I've been working with LlamaIndex's AgentWorkflow framework - a promising multi-agent orchestration system that lets different specialized AI agents hand off tasks to each other. But there's been one frustrating issue: when Agent A hands off to Agent B, Agent B often fails to continue processing the user's original request, forcing users to repeat themselves.

This breaks the natural flow of conversation and creates a poor user experience. Imagine asking for research help, having an agent gather sources and notes, then when it hands off to the writing agent - silence. You have to ask your question again!

[The receiving agent doesn't immediately respond to the user's latest request - the user has to repeat their question.](https://preview.redd.it/ucl76xnmcyte1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc975569f3bda5238ebb5ed1e5b08ff7cc86049)

**Why This Happens: The Position Bias Problem**

After investigating, I discovered this stems from how large language models (LLMs) handle long conversations. They suffer from ""position bias"" - where information at the beginning of a chat gets ""forgotten"" as new messages pile up.

[Different positions in the chat context have different attention weights. Arxiv 2407.01100](https://preview.redd.it/ugtqdq2tdyte1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9978aef461521633c8e20786ed48d8a106a2de)

In AgentWorkflow:

1. User requests go into a memory queue first
2. Each tool call adds 2+ messages (call + result)
3. The original request gets pushed deeper into history
4. By handoff time, it's either buried or evicted due to token limits

[FunctionAgent puts both tool\_call and tool\_call\_result info into ChatMemory, which pushes user requests to the back of the queue.](https://preview.redd.it/ypd4caewdyte1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=240629c41c2f581dd7c3c8917912827358db5525)

Research shows that in an 8k token context window, information in the first 10% of positions can lose over 60% of its influence weight. The LLM essentially ""forgets"" the original request amid all the tool call chatter.

**Failed Attempts**

First, I tried the developer-suggested approach - modifying the handoff prompt to include the original request. This helped the receiving agent see the request, but it still lacked context about previous steps.

[The original handoff implementation didn't include user request information.](https://preview.redd.it/lbnm2laxcyte1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=261eb162385f7f471c92a7812c188404ed682548)

[The output of the updated handoff now includes both chat history review and user request information.](https://preview.redd.it/u5eukjkycyte1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=2956e9aa2f88ce7aa65da0f09fbdb93a7930aa27)

Next, I tried reinserting the original request after handoff. This worked better - the agent responded - but it didn't understand the full history, producing incomplete results.

[After each handoff, I copy the original user request to the queue's end. ](https://preview.redd.it/j5irsta0dyte1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4cbaf58ca093a06938e0ccf9cd7ea9164def92d)

**The Solution: Strategic Memory Management**

The breakthrough came when I realized we needed to work with the LLM's natural attention patterns rather than against them. My solution:

1. **Clean Chat History**: Only keep actual user messages and agent responses in the conversation flow
2. **Tool Results to System Prompt**: Move all tool call results into the system prompt where they get 3-5x more attention weight
3. **State Management**: Use the framework's state system to preserve critical context between agents

[Attach the tool call result as state info in the system\_prompt.](https://preview.redd.it/yj1wmx06eyte1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=96272c1d5ead65d83881780ae6ee4d92d7c0e7aa)

This approach respects how LLMs actually process information while maintaining all necessary context.

**The Results**

After implementing this:

* Receiving agents immediately continue the conversation
* They have full awareness of previous steps
* The workflow completes naturally without repetition
* Output quality improves significantly

For example, in a research workflow:

1. Search agent finds sources and takes notes
2. Writing agent receives handoff
3. It immediately produces a complete report using all gathered information

[ResearchAgent not only continues processing the user request but fully perceives the search notes, ultimately producing a perfect research report.](https://preview.redd.it/1hw8vza8dyte1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=b721645671c5639c2e0b7990395ed077a992900f)

**Why This Matters**

Understanding position bias isn't just about fixing this specific issue - it's crucial for anyone building LLM applications. These principles apply to:

* All multi-agent systems
* Complex workflows
* Any application with extended conversations

The key lesson: LLMs don't treat all context equally. Design your memory systems accordingly.

[In different LLMs, the positions where the model focuses on important info don't always match the actual important info spots. ](https://preview.redd.it/ex69ri8cdyte1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=d680659f6e9889775c4d24b650e06ac9791945df)

43,1jvwexo,Do professionals in the industry still refer to online sources or old code for solutions?,"Hey everyone,  
I’m currently studying and working on improving my skills in data science, and I’ve been wondering something:

Do professionals—those already working in the industry—still take reference from online sources like Stack Overflow, old GitHub repos, documentation, or even their previous Jupyter notebooks when they’re coding?

Sometimes I feel like I’m “cheating” when I google things I forgot or reuse snippets from old work. But is this actually a normal part of professional workflows?

For example, take this small code block below:

  
`# 1. Instantiate the random forest classifier`

`rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)`



`# 2. Create a dictionary of hyperparameters to tune`

`cv_params = {'max_depth': [None],`

`'max_features': [1.0],`

`'max_samples': [1.0],`

`'min_samples_leaf': [2],`

`'min_samples_split': [2],`

`'n_estimators': [300],`

`}`



`# 3. Define a list of scoring metrics to capture`

`scoring = ['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'f1']`



`# 4. Instantiate the GridSearchCV object`

`rf_cv = GridSearchCV(rf, cv_params, scoring=scoring, cv=4, refit='recall')`

But the truth is gaming is about fun, and playing with people you already like or who are similar to people you like is a massive fun multiplier

So the challenge is how would you design a method to achieve that? Multiple algorithms, or something simpler?  
  
My initial idea is raw, and ripe for improvement

During or after a game session is over you get to thumbs up or thumbs down players you enjoyed playing with. 

Later on if you are in a matchmaking queue the list of players you've thumbed up is consulted and the party that has players with the greatest total thumbs up points at the top of that list gets matched to your party if there is free space, and if you are at the top of the available people on their end too.

The end goal here is to make public matchmaking more fun, and feel more familiar as you get to play repeatedly with players you've enjoyed playing with before.

The main issue with this type of matchmaking is that over time it would be difficult for newer players to get enough thumbs up to get higher on the list. Harder to get to play with the people who already have a large pool of people they like to play with. I don't know how to solve that issue at the moment.",wang-bang,1744180578.0,23,7,0.95

Hey r/datascience,

Hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here regarding a potential career move. I'd appreciate any insights or perspectives you might have.

My Background:

Current Role: Data Science Manager at a Retail company.

Experience: ~8 years in Data Science (started as IC, now Manager).

Prior Experience: ~5 years in Finance/M&A before transitioning into data science.
The Opportunity:

I have an opportunity for a Head of Finance Analytics role, situated within (or closely supporting) the Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) function.

The Appeal: 
This role feels like a potentially great way to merge my two distinct career paths (Finance + Data Science). It leverages my domain knowledge from both worlds. The ""Head of"" title also suggests significant leadership scope.

The Nature of the Work:
The primary focus will be data analysis using SQL and BI tools to support financial planning and decision-making.
Revenue forecasting is also a key component.
However, it's not a traditional data science role. Expect limited exposure to diverse ML projects or building complex predictive models beyond forecasting.
The tech stack is not particularly advanced (likely more SQL/BI-centric than Python/R ML libraries).


My Concerns / Questions for the Community:

Career Trajectory - Title vs. Substance? 
Moving from a ""Data Science Manager"" to a ""Head of Finance Analytics"" seems like a step up title-wise. However, is shifting focus primarily to SQL/BI-driven analysis and forecasting, away from broader ML/DS projects and advanced techniques, a potential functional downstep or specialization that might limit future pure DS leadership roles?

Technical Depth vs. Seniority: 
As you move towards Head of/Director/VP levels, how critical is maintaining cutting-edge data science technical depth versus deep domain expertise (finance), strategic impact through analysis, and leadership? Does the type of technical work (e.g., complex SQL/BI vs. complex ML) become less defining at these senior levels?

Compensation Outlook: 
What does the compensation landscape typically look like for senior analytics leadership roles like ""Head of Finance Analytics,"" especially within FP&A or finance departments, compared to pure Data Science management/director tracks in tech or other industries? Trying to gauge the long-term financial implications.

I'm essentially weighing the unique opportunity to blend my background and gain a significant leadership title (""Head of"") against the trade-offs in the type of technical work and the potential divergence from a purely data science leadership path.

Has anyone made a similar move or have insights into navigating careers at the intersection of Data Science and Finance/FP&A, particularly in roles heavy on analysis and forecasting? Any perspectives on whether this is a strategic pivot leveraging my unique background or a potential limitation for future high-level DS roles would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

TL;DR: DS Manager (8 YOE DS, 5 YOE Finance) considering ""Head of Finance Analytics"" role. Opportunity to blend background + senior title. Work is mainly SQL/BI analysis + forecasting, less diverse/advanced DS. Worried about technical ""downstep"" vs. pure DS track & long-term compensation. Seeking advice.
